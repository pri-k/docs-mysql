<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic explains how to monitor the health of the <%= vars.product_full %> service
using the logs, metrics, and Key Performance Indicators
(KPIs) generated by <%= vars.product_short %> component VMs.

For general information about logging and metrics in <%= vars.platform_name %>, see
[Overview of Logging and Metrics](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/application-service/loggregator/data-sources.html).

## <a id="metrics"></a>About Metrics

Metrics are regularly-generated log messages that report measured component states.
The default metrics polling interval is 30 seconds for MySQL instances and 60 seconds for the service broker.

You can configure the interval for MySQL instance in the **Configure Monitoring** pane
in the <%= vars.product_short %> tile. For more information, see [Configure Monitoring](./install-config.html#monitoring).

Metrics are long, single lines of text that follow the format:

```
origin:"p.mysql" eventType:ValueMetric timestamp:1496776477930669688 deployment:"service-instance_2b5a001f-2bf3-460c-aee6-fd2253f9fb0c" job:"mysql" index:"b09df494-b731-4d06-a4b0-c2985ceedf4c" ip:"10.0.8.4" valueMetric:<name:"/p.mysql/performance/open_files" value:24 unit:"file" >
```

## <a id="access"></a>Access MySQL Metrics

To access MySQL metrics do either of the following:

+ [Use the Indicator Protocol Dashboard](#indicator)
+ [Use Log Cache](#log-cache)

###  <a id="indicator"></a>Use the Indicator Protocol Dashboard

You can use the Indicator Protocol dashboard to view Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
for <%= vars.product_short %> service instances. The dashboard includes a graphical representation of the KPIs and information about recommended alert thresholds.

For more information about the Indicator Protocol dashboard, see [Indicator Protocol Dashboard (Beta)](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/healthwatch/indicator-protocol.html).
For information about <%= vars.product_short %> KPIs, see [KPIs for MySQL Service Instances](#kpi) below.

To access KPIs using the Indicator Protocol dashboard:

1. Install the Healthwatch tile in <%= vars.ops_manager %>. See [Installing and Configuring Pivotal Healthwatch](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/healthwatch/installing.html).
1. Enable the Indicator Protocol add-on in <%= vars.ops_manager %>. See [Enable the Indicator Protocol Add-on](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/healthwatch/indicator-protocol.html#enable-add-on).
1. View the Indicator Protocol Dashboard by navigating to:

    ```
    https://healthwatch.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN/indicator-dashboards
    ```

The following image shows an example of the Indicator Protocol dashboard for a highly available
(HA) cluster service instance:

### <a id="log-cache"></a>Use Log Cache
<%= partial vars.path_to_partials + '/services/log-cache-cli-plugin',
:locals => {:service_name => vars.service_name, :platform_name => vars.platform_name} %>


## <a id="kpi"></a>KPIs for MySQL Service Instances

KPIs are metrics for MySQL service instances that you can monitor to ensure high performance
and discover emerging issues. KPIs can be either
raw component metrics or derived metrics generated by applying formulas to raw metrics.

Pivotal provides the following KPIs as general alerting and response guidance
for typical <%= vars.product_short %> installations.
Pivotal recommends that you alter the alert measures by observing historical trends.
You can also create your KPIs that are specific to your environment using the available component metrics.

For a list of all the <%= vars.product_short %> component metrics, see [Component Metrics](#component-metrics).

<%= partial vars.path_to_partials + '/mysql/monitoring/kpis-metrics/all-kpis' %>

## <a id="component-metrics"></a>Component Metrics

In addition to the above KPIs, the MySQL service emits the followings metrics
that can be used for monitoring and alerting:

  + [MySQL Metrics](#mysql-metrics)
  + [Disk Metrics](#disk-metrics)
  + [Leader-Follower Metrics](#l-f-metrics)
  + [Highly Available Cluster Metrics](#ha-metrics)

### <a id="mysql-metrics"></a>MySQL Metrics

All <%= vars.product_short %> service instances emit the following metrics:

<%= partial vars.path_to_partials + '/mysql/monitoring/kpis-metrics/mysql-metrics' %>

### <a id="disk-metrics"></a>Disk Metrics

All <%= vars.product_short %> services emit the following disk usage metrics:

<%= partial vars.path_to_partials + '/mysql/monitoring/kpis-metrics/disk-metrics' %>

### <a id="l-f-metrics"></a>Leader-Follower Metrics

Leader-follower VMs emit the followings metrics:

<%= partial vars.path_to_partials + '/mysql/monitoring/kpis-metrics/l-f-metrics' %>

### <a id="ha-metrics"></a>Highly Available Cluster Metrics

HA clusters emit the followings metrics:

<%= partial vars.path_to_partials + '/mysql/monitoring/kpis-metrics/ha-metrics' %>
