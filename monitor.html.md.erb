<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes how to monitor the health of the MySQL for Pivotal Cloud
Foundry (PCF) service using the logs, metrics, and Key Performance Indicators
(KPIs) generated by MySQL for PCF component VMs.

For more information about logging and metrics in PCF, see
[Overview of Logging and Metrics](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/application-service/loggregator/data-sources.html).

## <a id="metrics"></a>About Metrics

Metrics are regularly-generated log entries that report measured component states.
The default metrics polling interval is 30 seconds for MySQL instances. For the service broker, the default is 60 seconds.

You can configure the interval for MySQL instance in **Configure Monitoring**
in the MySQL for PCF tile. For more information, see [Configure Monitoring](./install-config.html#monitoring).

Metrics are long, single lines of text with the format:

```
origin:"p.mysql" eventType:ValueMetric timestamp:1496776477930669688 deployment:"service-instance_2b5a001f-2bf3-460c-aee6-fd2253f9fb0c" job:"mysql" index:"b09df494-b731-4d06-a4b0-c2985ceedf4c" ip:"10.0.8.4" valueMetric:<name:"/p.mysql/performance/open_files" value:24 unit:"file" >
```

## <a id="access"></a>Access MySQL Metrics

To access MySQL metrics:

+ [Use the Indicator Protocol Dashboard](#indicator)
+ [Use Log Cache](#log-cache)

###  <a id="indicator"></a>Use the Indicator Protocol Dashboard

You can use the Indicator Protocol dashboard to view Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
for <%= vars.product_old %> service instances. The dashboard includes a graphical representation of the KPIs and information about recommended alert thresholds.

For more information about the Indicator Protocol dashboard, see [Indicator Protocol Dashboard
(Beta)](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/healthwatch/indicator-protocol.html).
For information about <%= vars.product_old %> KPIs, see [KPIs for MySQL Service Instances](#kpi) below.

To access KPIs using the Indicator Protocol dashboard:

1. Install the Healthwatch tile in <%= vars.ops_manager %>. See [Installing
and Configuring Pivotal Healthwatch](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/healthwatch/installing.html).
1. Enable the Indicator Protocol add-on in <%= vars.ops_manager %>. See [Enable the Indicator Protocol
Add-on](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/healthwatch/indicator-protocol.html#enable-add-on).
1. View the Indicator Protocol Dashboard by navigating to:

    ```
    https://healthwatch.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN/indicator-dashboards
    ```

The following image shows an example of the Indicator Protocol dashboard for a highly available
(HA) cluster service instance:



![This screenshot shows KPIs for MySQL server availability, the
percentage of available connections, CPU utilization percentage, queries delta,
ephemeral disk percent, persistent disk percent, galera cluster node readiness,
galera cluster size, and galera cluster status. The value of the
metrics are shown as graphs over time.](indicator-dash.png)

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> <%= vars.product_short %> v2.6.6 and earlier show fewer KPIs.
Indicator Protocol dashboard does not include ephemeral and persistent disk usage, Galera cluster node
readiness, cluster size, and cluster status.</p>

## <a id="kpi"></a>KPIs for MySQL Service Instances

KPIs are metrics for MySQL service instances that you can monitor for two purposes:

- To ensure high performance.

- To discover emerging issues.

KPIs can be either raw component metrics or derived metrics generated by applying formulas to raw metrics.

Pivotal provides the following KPIs as general alerting and response guidance
for typical MySQL for PCF installations.
Pivotal recommends that you continue to fine-tune the alert measures
by observing historical trends.
Pivotal also recommends that you expand beyond this guidance and create
new, installation-specific monitoring
metrics, thresholds, and alerts based on learning from your installations.

For a list of all the MySQL for PCF component metrics, see [Component Metrics](#component-metrics).

In addition to the above KPIs, the MySQL service emits the followings metrics for monitoring and alerting:

  + [MySQL Metrics](#mysql-metrics)
  + [Disk Metrics](#disk-metrics)
  + [Leader-Follower Metrics](#l-f-metrics)
  + [Highly Available Cluster Metrics](#ha-metrics)
