title: Monitoring and KPIs for On-Demand MySQL for PCF
owner: MySQL
---

This topic explains how to monitor the health of the MySQL for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) service using the logs, metrics, and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) generated by MySQL for PCF component VMs.

For general information about logging and metrics in PCF, see [Logging and Metrics](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/loggregator/index.html).

## <a id="metrics"></a>About Metrics

Metrics are regularly-generated log messages that report measured component states. The metrics polling interval is 30 seconds for MySQL instances and 60 seconds for the service broker.

Metrics are long, single lines of text that follow the format:

```
origin:"p.mysql" eventType:ValueMetric timestamp:1496776477930669688 deployment:"service-instance_2b5a001f-2bf3-460c-aee6-fd2253f9fb0c" job:"mysql" index:"b09df494-b731-4d06-a4b0-c2985ceedf4c" ip:"10.0.8.4" valueMetric:<name:"/p.mysql/performance/open_files" value:24 unit:"file" >
```

## <a id="kpi"></a>Key Performance Indicators

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for MySQL for PCF are metrics that operators find most useful for monitoring their MySQL service to ensure smooth operation. KPIs are high-signal-value metrics that can indicate emerging issues. KPIs can be raw component metrics or _derived_ metrics generated by applying formulas to raw metrics.

Pivotal provides the following KPIs as general alerting and response guidance for typical MySQL for PCF installations.
Pivotal recommends that operators continue to fine-tune the alert measures to their installation by observing historical trends.
Pivotal also recommends that operators expand beyond this guidance and create new, installation-specific monitoring
metrics, thresholds, and alerts based on learning from their own installations.

### <a id="kpi4MySQL"></a>KPIs for MySQL Service Instances

This section lists the KPIs that are specific for MySQL for PCF instances. 

For a list of general KPIs that apply to all instances, and not specifically to MySQL for PCF instances, see [BOSH System Health Metrics](#bosh).

For a list of all MySQL for PCF component metrics, see [All MySQL Metrics](#mysql-metrics).

### <a id="bosh"></a> BOSH System Health Metrics

<!-- Parital in https://github.com/pivotal-cf/docs-services-partials -->

<%= partial '../../p-mysql/odb/bosh_health_metrics' %>

All BOSH-deployed components generate the following system health metrics; these metrics also serve as KPIs for the MySQL for PCF service.

<%= partial './bosh_metrics' %>

## <a id="mysql-metrics"></a> All MySQL Metrics

In addition to the above KPIs, the MySQL service emits the followings metrics that can be used for monitoring and alerting.
