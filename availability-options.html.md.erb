This topic describes and contrasts the three topologies for MySQL and explains the kind of
availability each provides.

## <a id="three-topologies"></a> Three Topologies

The three topologies offered in MySQL for PCF v2.5 are as follows:

+ Single node—This simple one-VM topology is inexpensive and good for testing and for apps
  where high availability is not important.

+ Leader-follower—This two-VM topology gives you redundancy through failover of the leader
  to the follower.
  For more information, see [About Leader-Follower](./about-leader-follower.html).

+ Highly available (HA) cluster—This three-VM plus jumpbox cluster uses a patched Galera cluster,
Percona XtraDB Cluster (PXC), to provide the greatest availability of the three topologies.
For more information, see [About Highly Available Clusters](./about-ha.html).

## <a id="pros-and-cons"></a> Pros and Cons

The table below lists some key characteristics of the three topologies to help you decide
which one is best for your developers.

          </ul>
       </td>
  </tr>
</table>


## <a id="rpo-and-rto"></a> RPOs and RTOs

Recovery point objective (RPO) and recovery time objective (RTO) are important considerations
for availability.

The tables below describe the RPOs and RTOs for the three topologies.

### <a id="rpo"></a> RPOs

This table compares the recovery point objectives for the three topology types.

<table class="nice">
  <tr><th>Type of downtime</th><th>Single Node</th><th>Leader-Follower</th><th>Highly Available Cluster</th></tr>
  <tr><td><strong>Planned Maintenance</strong></td><td>Zero</td>
      <td>Zero</td><td>Zero</td></tr>
  <tr><td><strong>Unplanned Downtime</strong></td><td>Zero</td>
      <td>Replica lag or 0 if in sync mode</td><td>Almost zero*</td></tr>
  <tr><td><strong>Data Recovery</strong></td><td>Time since last backup</td>
      <td>The time to initialize the follower VM or 0 if in sync mode</td><td>Almost zero*</td></tr>
</table>

 *Database clients are notified that incomplete transactions are not saved.

### <a id="rto"></a> RTOs

This table compares the recovery time objectives for the three topology types.

<table class="nice">
  <tr><th>Type of downtime</th><th>Single Node</th><th>Leader-Follower</th><th>Highly Available Cluster</th></tr>
  <tr><td><strong>Planned Maintenance</strong></td><td>Time required to recreate the VM and reconnect to storage</td>
      <td>Time required depends on the type of maintenance</td>
      <td>Almost zero*</td></tr>
  <tr><td><strong>Unplanned Downtime</strong></td><td>Time required to recreate the VM and reconnect to storage</td>
      <td>Time required to restore the VM or time for operator to initiate failover and
          for failover to complete</td>
      <td>Almost zero*</td></tr>
  <tr><td><strong>Data Recovery</strong></td><td>Time to restore from backup</td>
      <td>Time for operator to initiate failover and for failover to complete</td><td>Almost zero*</td></tr>
</table>

 *This includes time for apps to reconnect to the MySQL service instance.


## <a id="risk"></a> Risk

When choosing a topology, risk is a factor to consider.
Risk, in this case, encompasses the likelihood of:

+ Operators being interrupted to perform disaster recovery

+ Encountering issues because of the complexity of the topology and technology

Single node topology has the lowest risk.
Highly available clusters have the highest risk.

<table class="nice">
  <tr><th>Topology</th><th>Risk-level</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Single node</td><td>low</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Leader-follower</td><td>medium</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Highly available cluster</td><td>high</td></tr>
</table>
