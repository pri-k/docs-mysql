###<a id="unable-to-determine"></a>Unable to Determine Leader and Follower (Errand Error)

This problem happens when the <code>configure-leader-follower</code>
errand fails because it cannot determine the VM roles.

#### Symptom

The <code>configure-leader-follower</code> errand exits with <code>1</code>
and the errand logs contain the following:

<pre class="terminal">$ Unable to determine leader and follower based on transaction history.</pre>

#### Explanation

Something has happened to the instances, such as a failure or manual intervention.
As a result, there is not enough information available to determine the correct state
and topology without operator intervention to resolve the issue.

#### Solution

Use the <code>inspect</code> errand to determine which instance should be the leader. Then, using the
<a href="./about-leader-follower.html#errands">orchestration</a>
errands and backup/restore, you can put the service instance into a safe topology, and then rerun the
<code>configure-leader-follower</code> errand. This is shown in the example below.
This example shows one outcome that the <code>inspect</code> errand can return:

<ol>
  <li>Use the
    <code>inspect</code>
    errand to retrieve relevant information about the two VMs:
    <pre class="terminal">
  $ bosh -e my-env -d my-dep run-errand inspect

  2 errand(s)<br />
  Succeeded
  </pre>
    In the above scenario, the first instance is missing data but does not have replication configured. The second instance has data, and also has replication configured. The instructions below resolve this by copying data to the first instance, and
    resuming replication.</li>
  <li>Take a backup of the second instance using the
    <a href="backup-and-restore.html#manual-backup">Manual Backup</a>
    steps.</li>
  <li>Restore the backup artifact to the first instance using the
    <a href="backup-and-restore.html#restore">Manual Restore</a>
    steps.<br><br>
    At this point, the instances have equivalent data.</li>
  <li>
    Run the <code>configure-leader-follower</code> errand to reconfigure replication:
    <pre><code>bosh -e ENVIRONMENT -d DEPLOYMENT run-errand configure-leader-follower --instance=mysql/GUID-OF-LEADER</code></pre>
    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">$ bosh -e my-env -d my-dep \
    run-errand configure-leader-follower \
    --instance=mysql/4ecad54b-0704-47eb-8eef-eb228cab9724</pre>
  </li>
</ol>

###<a id="both-writable"></a>Both Leader and Follower Instances Are Writable (Errand Error)

This problem happens when the<code>configure-leader-follower</code>

errand fails because both VMs are writable and the VMs might hold differing data.
#### Symptom

The <code>configure–leader-follower</code> errand exits with <code>1</code>
and the errand logs contain the following:

<pre class="terminal">$ Both mysql instances are writable. Please ensure no divergent data and set one instance to read-only mode.</pre>

#### Explanation

<%= vars.product_name %> tries to ensure that there is only one writable instance of the
leader-follower pair at any given time. However, in certain situations, such as
network partitions, or manual intervention outside of the provided bosh
errands, it is possible for both instances to be writable.
The service instances remain in this state until an operator resolves the issue
to ensure that the correct instance is promoted and reduce the potential for data divergence.

#### Solution

<ol>
  <li>
    Use the
    <code>inspect</code> errand to retrieve the GTID Executed set for each VM:

    <pre class="terminal">$ bosh -e my-env -d my-dep run-errand inspect
  [...]
  Instance   mysql/4ecad54b-0704-47eb-8eef-eb228cab9724

  2 errand(s)<br />
  Succeeded
</pre>
    If the GTID Executed sets for both instances are the same, continue to Step 2. If they are different, continue to Step 4.</li>
  <li>Look at the value of GTID Executed for both instances.
    <ul>
      <li>If the range after the GUID is equivalent, either instance can be made read-only, as described in Step 3.</li>
      <li>If one instance has a range that is a subset of the other, the instance with the subset should must be made read-only, as described in Step 3.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Based on the information you gathered in the step above, run the
    <code>make-read-only</code>
    errand to make the appropriate instance read-only:
    <pre><code>bosh -e ENVIRONMENT -d DEPLOYMENT run-errand make-read-only --instance=mysql/MYSQL-SUBSET-INSTANCE</code></pre>
    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">$ bosh -e my-env -d my-dep \
        run-errand make-read-only \
        --instance=mysql/e0b94ade-0114-4d49-a929-ce1616d8beda
      [...]
      succeeded</pre>
  </li>
  <li>If the GTID Executed sets are neither equivalent nor subsets, data has diverged and you must determine what data has diverged as part of the procedure below:
    <ol>
      <li>Use the
        <code>make-read-only</code>
        errand to set both instances to read-only to prevent further data divergence.
        <pre><code>bosh -e ENVIRONMENT -d DEPLOYMENT run-errand make-read-only --instance=mysql/MYSQL-INSTANCE</code></pre>
        For example:
        <pre class="terminal">$ bosh -e my-env -d my-dep \
            run-errand make-read-only \
            --instance=mysql/e0b94ade-0114-4d49-a929-ce1616d8beda
            [...]
            succeeded</pre>
      </li>
      <li>Take a backup of both instances using the
        <a href="backup-and-restore.html#manual-backup">Manual Backup</a>
        steps.</li>
      <li>Manually inspect the data on each instance to determine the discrepancies and put the data on the instance that is further ahead---this instance has the higher GTID Executed set, and will be the new leader.</li>
      <li>Migrate all appropriate data to the new leader instance.</li>
      <li>After putting all data on the leader, ssh onto the follower:
        <pre><code>bosh -e ENVIRONMENT -d DEPLOYMENT ssh mysql/GUID-OF-FOLLOWER</code></pre>
        For example:
        <pre class="terminal">$ bosh -e my-env -d my-dep ssh mysql/e0b94ade-0114-4d49-a929-ce1616d8beda</pre>
      </li>
      <li>Become root with the command
        <code>sudo su</code>.<br></li>
      <li>Stop the mysql process with the command
        <code>monit stop mysql</code>.</li>
      <li>Delete the data directory of the follower with the command
        <code>rm -rf /var/vcap/store/mysql</code>.</li>
      <li>Start the mysql process with the command
        <code>monit start mysql</code>.</li>
      <li>Use the
        <code>configure-leader-follower</code>
        errand to copy the leader's data to the follower and resume replication:
        <pre><code>bosh -e ENVIRONMENT -d DEPLOYMENT run-errand configure-leader-follower --instance=mysql/GUID-OF-LEADER</code></pre>
        For example:
        <pre class="terminal">$ bosh -e my-env -d my-dep \
          run-errand configure-leader-follower \
          --instance=mysql/4ecad54b-0704-47eb-8eef-eb228cab9724</pre>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

###<a id="both-read-only"></a>Both Leader and Follower Instances Are Read-Only

In a leader-follower topology, the leader VM is writable and the follower VM is read-only.
However if both VMs are read only, apps cannot write to the database.

#### Symptom

Developers report that apps cannot write to the database.

#### Explanation

This problem happens if the leader VM fails and the BOSH Resurrector is enabled.
When the leader is resurrected, it is set as read-only.

#### Solution

<ol>
  <li>
    Use the
    <code>inspect</code>
    errand to confirm that both VMs are in a read-only state:
    <pre>bosh -e ENVIRONMENT -d DEPLOYMENT run-errand inspect</pre>
  </li>
  <li>Examine the output and locate the information about the leader-follower MySQL VMs:
    <pre class="terminal">

Succeeded
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    If Read Only is set to
    <code>true</code>
    for both VMs, make the leader writable using the following command:
    <pre>bosh -e ENVIRONMENT -d DEPLOYMENT run-errand configure-leader-follower --instance=mysql/GUID-OF-LEADER</pre>
    For example, if the second instance above is the leader:
    <pre class="terminal">
$ bosh -e my-env -d my-dep \
  run-errand configure-leader-follower \
  --instance=mysql/e0exampleade-0114-4d49-a929-cexample8beda
</pre>
  </li>
</ol>

###<a id="persistent-disk"></a>Persistent Disk is Full

If your persistent disk is full, apps become inoperable.
In this state, read, write, and Cloud Foundry Command-Line Interface (cf CLI) operations do not work.

#### Symptom

Developers report thatread, write, and cf CLI operations do not work.
Developers cannot upgrade to a larger MySQL service plan to free up disk space.

#### Explanation

This problem happens if your persistent disk is full.
When you use the BOSH CLI to target your deployment, you see that instances are at 100% persistent disk usage.
<br><br>
Available disk space can be increased by deleting audit log files.
After deleting audit logs, you can then upgrade to a larger MySQL service plan.

#### Solution

The solution to this problem is to confirm that your persistent disk is full, and then
delete an audit log file to free up disk space. When the disk is no longer full,
the service instance can be upgraded to a larger plan to prevent the disk from becoming full again.<br><br>
Follow the steps below:

<ol>
  <li>
    To retrieve and record the GUID of your service instance, run the following command:
    <br>
    <pre>cf service SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME --guid</pre>
    Where
    <code>SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME</code>
    is the name of your service instance.
    <br><br>
    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">$ cf service my-service-instance --guid
    12345678-90ab-cdef-1234-567890abcdef</pre>
    If you do not know the name of your service instance, you can list service instances in the space with
    <code>cf services</code>.
  </li>

  <li>
    To confirm that your persistent disk usage is at 100%, run the following command:
    <br>
    <pre>bosh -d service-instance_SERVICE-INSTANCE-GUID instances --vitals</pre>
    Where
    <code>SERVICE-INSTANCE-GUID</code>
    is the GUID you recorded in the above step.<br><br>
    For example:
    <pre class="terminal"> $ bosh -d service-instance_12345678-90ab-cdef-1234-567890abcdef instances --vitals

###<a id="unresponsive"></a>Unresponsive Node in a Highly Available Cluster

#### Symptom

A client connected to a MySQL cluster node reports the following error:

<pre class="terminal">WSREP has not yet prepared this node for application use</pre>
<br>
Some clients might instead return the following:
<pre class="terminal">
  unknown error
</pre>

#### Explanation

If the client is connected to a MySQL cluster node and that node loses connection to the rest of the cluster, the node stops accepting writes. If the connection to this node is made through the proxy, the proxy automatically
re-routes further connections to a different node.
<br><br>

#### Solutions

A node can become unresponsive for a number of reasons. For solutions, see the following:

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Network Latency</strong>: If network latency causes a node to become unresponsive, the node drops but eventually rejoins. The node automatically rejoins only if one node has left the cluster. Consult your IaaS network settings to reduce your network latency.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>MySQL Process Failure:</strong> If the MySQL process crashes, <code>monit</code>
    and BOSH should restore the process. If the process is not restored, run the
    <code>download-logs</code> tool and consult the error logs it generates. For more information, see the
    <a href="#download-logs">download-logs</a> section below.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Firewall Rule Change:</strong>
    If your firewall rules change, it might prevent a node from communicating with the rest of the cluster. This causes the node to become unresponsive. In this case, the logs show the node leaving the cluster but do not show network latency errors.
    <br><br>
    To confirm that the node is unresponsive because of a firewall rule change, SSH from a responsive node to the unresponsive node. If you cannot connect, the node is unresponsive due to a firewall rule change. Change your firewall rules to enable the
    unresponsive node to rejoin the cluster.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>VM Failure:</strong>
    If you cannot SSH into a node and you are not detecting either network latency or firewall issues, your node might be down due to VM failure. To confirm that the node is unresponsive and re-create the VM, see
    <a href="#recreate-VM">
      Re-create a Corrupted VM in a Highly Available</a>
    below.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Node Unable to Rejoin:</strong> If a detached existing node fails to join the cluster, its
    <code>sequence_number</code> might be higher than those of the nodes with quorum. A higher
    <code>sequence_number</code> on the detached node indicates that it has recent changes to the
     data that the primary component lacks. You can check this by looking at the node's error log at
    <code>/var/vcap/sys/log/pxc-mysql/mysql.err.log</code>.
    <br><br>
    To restore the cluster, do one the following:
    <ul>
      <li>If the detached node has a higher sequence number than the primary component, do the procedures in
        <a href="./bootstrapping.html">Bootstrapping</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        If bootstrapping does not restore the cluster, you can manually force
        the node to rejoin the cluster. This removes all of the unsynchronized data
        from the detached server node and creates a new copy of the cluster data on the node. For more
        information, see <a href="#manual-force">Force a Node to Rejoin a Highly Available Cluster Manually</a> below.
        <p class="note warning">
          <strong>Warning</strong>: Forcing a node to rejoin the cluster is a destructive procedure. Only do this procedure with the assistance of
          <a href="https://support.pivotal.io">Pivotal Support</a>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

###  <a id="replication-errors"></a>  Many Replication Errors in Logs for Highly Available Clusters

This problem happens when there are errors in SQL statements.

#### Symptom

You see many replication errors in the MySQL logs, like the following:

<pre class="terminal">
  160318 9:25:16 [Warning] WSREP: RBR event 1 Query apply warning: 1, 16992456
160318 9:25:16 [Warning] WSREP: Ignoring error for TO isolated action: source: abcd1234-abcd-1234-abcd-1234abcd1234 version: 3 local: 0 state: APPLYING flags: 65 conn_id: 246804 trx_id: -1 seqnos (l: 865022, g: 16992456, s: 16992455, d: 16992455, ts: 2530660989030983)
160318 9:25:16 [ERROR] Slave SQL: Error 'Duplicate column name 'number'' on query. Default database: 'cf_0123456_1234_abcd_1234_abcd1234abcd'. Query: 'ALTER TABLE ...'
</pre>

#### Explanation and Solution

For solutions for replication errors in MySQL log files, see the table below.

<table class="nice">
  <tr>
    <th>Additional Error</th>
    <th>Solution</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <code>ALTER TABLE</code>
      errors</td>
    <td>Fix the
      <code>ALTER TABLE</code>
      error.<br>
      This error can occur when an app issues an invalid data definition statement. Other nodes log this problem as a replication error because they fail to replicate the
      <code>ALTER TABLE</code>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Increased persistent disk usage or running out of working memory</td>
    <td>Decode the
      <code>GRA_*.log</code>
      files and look for errors. See
      <a href="https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/How-to-decode-Galera-GRA-logs-for-MySQL-for-pcf-v1-10">
        How to decode Galera GRA log files</a>
      in the Pivotal Support knowledge base. The GRA log files contain failing DDL statements.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

If you see replication errors, but no <code>ALTER TABLE</code>
or persistent disk or memory issues, you can ignore the replication errors.

### <a id="instance-creds"></a> Retrieve Admin and Read-Only Admin Credentials for a Service Instance

To retrieve the admin and read-only admin credentials for a service instance from BOSH CredHub, perform the following steps:

<ol>
  <li>Use the cf CLI to determine the GUID associated with the service instance
    for which you want to retrieve credentials. Run the following command:
    <pre><code>cf service service-instance --guid</code></pre>
    <br>
    Where <code>SERVICE-INSTANCE</code> is the name of the service instance.
    <br><br>
    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">$ cf service my-service-instance --guid
    12345678-90ab-cdef-1234-567890abcdef</pre>
    If you do not know the name of the service instance, you can list service instances in the space with
    <code>cf services</code>.
  </li>
  <li>Perform the steps in
    <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#gather">Gather Credential and IP Address Information</a>
    and
    <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#ssh">SSH into Ops Manager</a>
    of
    <em>Advanced Troubleshooting with the BOSH CLI to SSH into the Ops Manager VM</em>.
  </li>
  <li>From the Pivotal Ops Manager VM, log in to your BOSH Director with the BOSH CLI. See
    <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#log-in">Log in to the BOSH Director</a>
    in
    <em>Advanced Troubleshooting with the BOSH CLI</em>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Follow the steps in
    <a href="prepare-tls.html#credhub-creds">Find the CredHub Credentials</a>, and record the values for
    <code>identity</code>
    and
    <code>password</code>.</li>
  <li>Set the API target of the CredHub CLI to your BOSH CredHub server.
    <br><br>
    Run the following command:
    <pre><code>credhub api https://BOSH-DIRECTOR:8844 --ca-cert=/var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate</code></pre>    <br>
    Where
    <code>BOSH-DIRECTOR</code>
    is the IP address of the BOSH Director VM.
    <br><br>
    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">$ credhub api http<span>s:</span>//10.0.0.5:8844 --ca-cert=/var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    Log in to CredHub.
    <br><br>
    Run the following command:
    <pre><code>credhub login \
    --client-name=CREDHUB-CLIENT-NAME \
    --client-secret=CREDHUB-CLIENT-SECRET</code></pre>
    Where:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>CREDHUB-CLIENT-NAME</code>
        is the
        <code>identity</code>
        you recorded in
        <a href="prepare-tls.html#credhub-creds">Find the CredHub Credentials</a>.</li>
      <li>
        <code>CREDHUB-CLIENT-SECRET</code>
        is the
        <code>password</code>
        you recorded in
        <a href="prepare-tls.html#credhub-creds">Find the CredHub Credentials</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">$ credhub login \
      --client-name=credhub \
      --client-secret=abcdefghijklm123456789</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    Use the CredHub CLI to retrieve the credentials.
    <ul>
      <li>
        To retrieve the password for the admin user, run the following command:
        <pre><code>credhub get -n /p-bosh/service-instance_GUID/admin_password</code></pre>
        In the output, the password appears under
        <code>value</code>.</li>
      <br>
      <li>
        To retrieve the password for the read-only admin user, run the following command:
        <pre>credhub get -n /p-bosh/service-instance_GUID/read_only_admin_password</pre>
        In the output, the password appears under
        <code>value</code>.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    For example:

###  <a id="trouble-ha"></a>Techniques for Troubleshooting Highly Available Clusters

If your cluster is experiencing downtime or in a degraded state, Pivotal recommends
gathering information to diagnose the type of failure the cluster is experiencing with  the following workflow:

<ol>
  <li>Consult solutions for common errors. See
    <a href="#ha-errors">Highly Available Cluster Troubleshooting Errors</a>
    above.
  </li>
  <li>Use
    <code>mysql-diag</code>
    to view a summary of the network, disk, and replication state of each cluster node. Depending on the output from
    <code>mysql-diag</code>, you might recover your cluster with the following troubleshooting techniques:
    <ul>
      <li>To force a node to rejoin the cluster, see
        <a href="#manual-force">Force a Node to Rejoin a Highly Available Cluster Manually</a>
        below.</li>
      <li>To re-create a corrupted VM, see
        <a href="#recreate-VM">Re-create a Corrupted VM in a Highly Available Cluster</a>
        below.</li>
      <li>To check if replication is working, see
        <a href="#check-replication">Check Replication in a Highly Available Cluster</a>
        below.</li>
    </ul>
    For more information about
    <code>mysql-diag</code>, see
    <a href="./mysql-diag.html">Running mysql-diag</a>.
  </li>

  <li>
    Run <code>download-logs</code> against each node in your MySQL cluster, MySQL proxies, and jumpbox VM. You must run
    <code>download-logs</code> before attempting recovery because any failures in the recovery procedure can result in logs being lost or made inaccessible.
    <br>
    For more information, see the <a href="#download-logs">download-logs</a>
    section below.
    <br>
    <p class="note">
      <strong>Note:</strong>
      Pivotal recommends that you use the <code>-X</code> flag to get the complete
      set of available logs. However, if your cluster processes a high volume of
      transactions, the complete set might be too large and you can omit this flag
      to fetch the essential set of logs.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    If you are uncertain about the recovery steps to take, submit a ticket through
    <a href="https://support.pivotal.io/">Pivotal Support</a>. When you submit a ticket provide the following information:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>mysql-diag output:</strong>
        A summary of the network, disk, and replication state. The
        <a href="./mysql-diag.html">Running mysql-diag</a>
        topic explains how to run
        <strong>mysql-diag</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>download-logs logs:</strong>
        Logs from your MySQL cluster, MySQL proxies, and jumpbox VM. The
        <a href="#download-logs" ">download-logs</a>
        section below explains how to run
        <strong>download-logs</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Deployment environment:</strong>
        The environment that <%= vars.product_name %> is running in such as <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> or a service tile.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Version numbers:</strong>
        The versions of the installed Ops Manager, <%= vars.app_runtime_full %>, and <%= vars.product_name %>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p class="note warning">
  <strong>Warning:</strong>
  Do not attempt to resolve cluster issues by reconfiguring the cluster, such as changing the number of nodes or networks. Only follow the diagnosis steps in this document. If you are unsure how to proceed, contact
  <a href="https://support.pivotal.io/">Pivotal Support</a>.
</p>


### <a id="manual-force"></a> Force a Node to Rejoin a Highly Available Cluster Manually

If a detached node fails to rejoin the cluster after a configured grace period,
you can manually force the node to rejoin the cluster.
This procedure removes all the data on the node, forces the node to join the cluster,
and creates a new copy of the cluster data on the node.


<p class="note warning">
  <strong>Warning:</strong>
  If you manually force a node to rejoin the cluster, data stored on the local node is lost. Do not force nodes to rejoin the cluster if you want to preserve unsynchronized data. Only do this procedure with the assistance of
  <a href="https://support.pivotal.io">Pivotal Support</a>.
</p>

Before following this procedure, try to bootstrap the cluster. For more information, see
<a href="./bootstrapping.html">Bootstrapping</a>.
<br><br>
To manually force a node to rejoin the cluster, do the following:

<ol>
  <li>
    To SSH into the node, follow the procedure in
    <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#bosh-ssh">BOSH SSH</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    To become root, run the following command:
    <pre> sudo su</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    To shut down the
    <code>mysqld</code>
    process on the node, run the following command:
    <pre>  monit stop galera-init </pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    To remove the unsynchronized data on the node, run the following command:
    <pre>  rm -rf /var/vcap/store/pxc-mysql</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    To prepare the node before restarting, run the following command:
    <pre>  /var/vcap/jobs/pxc-mysql/bin/pre-start</pre>
  </li>
  <li>To restart the
    <code>mysqld</code>
    process, run the following command:
    <pre> monit start galera-init</pre>
  </li>
</ol>


### <a id="recreate-VM"></a>Re-create a Corrupted VM in a Highly Available Cluster

To re-create a corrupted VM, do the following:

<ol>
  <li>To log in to the BOSH Director VM, do the following procedures:
    <ol>
      <li>To gather the information needed to log in to the BOSH Director VM, see
        <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#gather">Gather Credential and IP Address Information</a>&#46;</li>

To check the replication status, do the following:

<ol>
  <li>To log in to the BOSH Director VM, do the following procedures:
    <ol>
      <li>To gather the information needed to log in to the BOSH Director VM, see
        <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#gather">Gather Credential and IP Address Information</a>.
      </li>
      <li>To log in to the Ops Manager VM, see
        <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#ssh">Log in to the Ops Manager VM with SSH</a>.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    To create a dummy database in the first node, run the following command:
    <pre>mysql -h first-node-ip-address -u your-identity -p -e "create database verify_healthy;"</pre>
    Where:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>FIRST-NODE-IP-ADDRESS</code>
        is the IP address of the first node you recorded in step 1.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>YOUR-IDENTITY</code> is the value of <code>identity</code>
        that you recorded in step 1.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    To create a dummy table in the dummy database, do the following:
    <pre>mysql -h first-node-ip-address -u your-identity -p -d verify_healthy -e "create table dummy_table (id int not null primary key auto_increment, info text) engine='innodb';"</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    To insert data into the dummy table, run the following command:
    <pre>mysql -h FIRST-NODE-IP-ADDRESS -u YOUR-IDENTITY -p -D verify_healthy -e "insert into dummy_table(info) values ('dummy data'),('more dummy data'),('even more dummy data');"</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      To query the table and verify that the three rows of dummy data exist on the first node, run the following:
    </p>
    <pre>mysql -h first-node-ip-address -u your-identity -p -d verify_healthy -e "select * from dummy_table;"</pre>

    When prompted for a password, provide the <code>password</code>
    value recorded in step 1.<br>
    The above command returns output similar to the following:
    <pre class="terminal">
  +----+----------------------+
  | id | info                 |
  +----+----------------------+
  |  4 | dummy data           |
  |  7 | more dummy data      |
  | 10 | even more dummy data |
  +----+----------------------+</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    To verify that the other nodes contain the same dummy data do the following for each of the remaining MySQL server IP addresses:
    <ul>
      <li>To query the dummy table, do the following:
        <pre class="terminal">mysql -h NEXT-NODE-IP-ADDRESS -u YOUR-IDENTITY -p -D verify\_healthy -e "select * from dummy_table;"</pre>

        When prompted for a password, provide the
        <code>password</code>
        value recorded in step 1.
      </li>
      <li>
        To verify that the node contains the same three rows of dummy data as the other nodes, run the following command:

        <pre class="terminal">mysql -h NEXT-NODE-IP-ADDRESS -u YOUR-IDENTITY -p -D verify\_healthy -e "select * from dummy\_table;"</pre>

        When prompted for a password, provide the
        <code>password</code>
        value recorded in step 1. Verify that the above command returns output similar to the following:
        <pre class="terminal">
    +----+----------------------+
    | id | info                 |
    +----+----------------------+
    |  4 | dummy data           |
    |  7 | more dummy data      |
    | 10 | even more dummy data |
    +----+----------------------+ </pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    If each MySQL server instance does not return the same result, before proceeding
    further or making any changes to your deployment, contact
    <a href="https://support.pivotal.io/">Pivotal Support</a>
    <br>
    If each MySQL server instance returns the same result, then you can safely proceed
    to scaling down your cluster to a single node.

##  <a id="tools"></a>  Tools for Troubleshooting

The troubleshooting techniques described above use the following tools.

### <a id="download-logs"></a>download-logs

`download-logs` is a script that you can run from your Ops Manager VM to aggregate
logs from your MySQL cluster nodes, MySQL proxies, and, with highly available clusters, the jumpbox VM.
Do the following to run the `download-logs` script:

1. Download and unpack the `download-logs` script from [<%= vars.product_name %>](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-mysql) on Pivotal Network.

1. From Ops Manager, open your **BOSH Director** tile > **Credentials** tab.

1. Click **Bosh Commandline Credentials** > **Link to Credential**. A short plaintext file opens.

4. From the plaintext file, record the values listed for the following:
  + `BOSH_CLIENT`
  + `BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET`
  + `BOSH_CA_CERT`
  + `BOSH_ENVIRONMENT`

1. From the BOSH CLI, run `bosh deployments` and record the name of the BOSH deployment that deployed <%= vars.product_name %>.

1. SSH into your Ops Manager VM. For information on how to do this, see
[Gather Credential and IP Address Information](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#gather)
and [SSH into Ops Manager](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#ssh).

1. File transfer or copy-paste the `download-logs` script to a working directory on the Ops Manager VM.

1. Set local environment variables to the same BOSH variable values that you recorded earlier,
including `BOSH_DEPLOYMENT` for the deployment name. For example:

    <pre class="terminal">$ BOSH_CLIENT=ops_manager BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET=a123bc-E_4Ke3fb-gImbl3xw4a7meW0rY BOSH_CA_CERT=/var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate BOSH_ENVIRONMENT=10.0.0.5 BOSH_DEPLOYMENT=pivotal-mysql-14c4</pre>

1. Run the `download-logs` script, passing the output directory to the `-o` flag:

    ```
    ./download-logs -o .
    ```

1. The script saves a compressed file of logs combined from all MySQL VMs.
The filename has the form `TIMESTAMP-mysql-logs.tar.gz.gpg`.

###  <a id="mysql-diag"></a>  mysql-diag

`mysql-diag` outputs the current status of a highly available (HA) MySQL cluster
in <%= vars.platform_name %> and suggests recovery actions if the cluster fails.
For more information, see [Running mysql-diag](./mysql-diag.html).
