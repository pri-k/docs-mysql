## <a id="overview"></a>Overview

In <%= vars.product_name %> v2.7 and later,
you can configure replication between two <%= vars.single_leader_plan %> service instances
across multiple foundations or data centers to create a leader-follower topology.

In a <%= vars.single_leader_plan_lc %> context,
the two <%= vars.single_leader_plan %> service instances are
referred to as a decoupled leader-follower service instance.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong>
  A decoupled leader-follower service instance deployed across multiple
  foundations or data centers is different from the coupled leader-follower plan that
  <%= vars.product_name %> offers.
  For information about the coupled leader-follower plan,
  see <a href="./about-leader-follower.html">About Leader-Follower</a>.
</p>

For more information about multi-site architecture,
see [About <%= vars.single_leader_plan %>](./about-multi-site.html).

## <a id="prereq"></a>Prerequisites

Before you use <%= vars.product_name %> across multiple foundations or data centers, you must have:

+ Access to the <%= vars.single_leader_plan %> plan
+ A multi-site architecture configured by a operator
For more information configuring a multi-site architecture,
see [Preparing for <%= vars.single_leader_plan %>](./prepare-multi-site.html).

## <a id='create-multi-dc'></a>Create a Multi-Foundation Leader-Follower Service Instance

To set up a leader-follower service instance of <%= vars.product_name %> across multiple foundations
or data centers:

1. Check the availability of the <%= vars.single_leader_plan %> service in the Marketplace in both your
foundations.
See [Confirm the <%= vars.product_name %> Service Availability](use.html#marketplace).
1. Create <%= vars.single_leader_plan %> service instances to configure a
decoupled multi-site leader-follower service instance.
See [Create <%= vars.single_leader_plan %> Service Instances](#create-multi-dc), below.
1. Establish a connection between the <%= vars.single_leader_plan %> service instances to enable
replication.
See [Configure <%= vars.single_leader_plan %>](#create-service-key), below.
1. Bind the  <%= vars.single_leader_plan %> service instances to your apps.
See [Bind a Leader-Follower Service Instance to Your App](#bind), below.
5. Modify your app to use the <%= vars.product_name %> service.
See [Use the MySQL Service in Your App](./use.html#call).

After you create a leader-follower service instance across multiple foundations or data centers,
you can manage it over the life cycle of your apps and data.
For instructions on how to manage a <%= vars.product_name %> service instance,
see [Manage Service Instances](./use.html#manage).

### <a id='create-service-instance'></a>Create <%= vars.single_leader_plan %> Service Instances

To create a leader-follower service instance across multiple foundations or data centers, you
must create a <%= vars.single_leader_plan %> service instance in two different
foundations.

Pivotal recommends that you create the leader <%= vars.single_leader_plan %> service instance
in your primary foundation and the follower <%= vars.single_leader_plan %>
service instance in your secondary foundation.

To create a leader-follower service instance:

1. Create a <%= vars.single_leader_plan %> service instance in your primary foundation:

    1. Log in to the deployment for your primary foundation by running:

        ```
        cf login PRIMARY-API-URL
        ```
        Where `PRIMARY-API-URL` is the API endpoint for the primary foundation.

    1. Create a primary service instance by running:

        ```
        cf create-service p.mysql PLAN PRIMARY-INSTANCE
        ```

        Where:
        - `PLAN` is the name of the <%= vars.single_leader_plan %> plan you want to use.
        - `PRIMARY-INSTANCE` is a name you choose to identify the service instance.
        This name appears under `service` in output from `cf services`.

        For example:

        <pre class="terminal">$ cf create-service p.mysql db-small primary-node<br>
        Creating service primary-node in org my-org / space my-space as admin...
        OK</pre>

        <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Do not name your service instance
          <code>leader</code> or <code>follower</code>. If you trigger a failover or switchover,
          the service instances in your primary and secondary foundations switch roles.
          For more information,
          see <a href="./multi-site-trigger-failover.html">Triggering Multi-Site Replication Failover and Switchover</a>.
        </p>

    1. (Optional) Watch the progress of the service instance creation by running:

        ```
        watch cf services
        ```

        Wait for the `last operation` for your instance to show as `create succeeded`.
        <br><br>
        For example:

        <pre class="terminal">$ watch cf services<br>
        Getting services in org my-org / space my-space as admin...
        OK
        name           service       plan        bound apps    last operation
        primary-node   p.mysql       db-small                  create succeeded
      </pre>
        If you get an error, see [Troubleshooting Instances](./troubleshoot-instances.html).

1. Create a <%= vars.single_leader_plan %> service instance in your secondary
foundation by repeating step 1 and replacing references to `primary` with `secondary`.

### <a id='create-service-key'></a>Configure <%= vars.single_leader_plan %>

After you create the leader and follower <%= vars.single_leader_plan %> service instances,
you must establish a connection between them to enable
replication.
You do this by creating multi-site replication service keys with the `host-info` of the follower instance
and the `credentials` of the leader instance.
You only use these service keys for establishing replication between <%= vars.single_leader_plan %>
service instances.

The following diagram describes the workflow for configuring multi-site replication:

![diagram summarizes the procedure below](configure-multi-site.png)

<a href="./images/configure-multi-site.png" target="_blank">View a larger version of this diagram</a>

The following steps assume that you have created the leader <%= vars.single_leader_plan %>
service instance in the primary foundation and the follower <%= vars.single_leader_plan %>
service instance in the secondary foundation. You created these service instances in
[Create <%= vars.single_leader_plan %> Service Instances](#create-multi-dc), above.

To create the service keys for your <%= vars.single_leader_plan %> service instances:

1. Create a host-info service key for the service instance in your secondary foundation by running:

    ```
    cf create-service-key SECONDARY-INSTANCE SERVICE-KEY \
      -c '{"replication-request": "host-info"}
    ```
    Where:
    + `SECONDARY-INSTANCE` is the name of the secondary service instance you created in
    step 2 of [Create <%= vars.single_leader_plan %> Service Instances](#create-multi-dc), above.
    + `SERVICE-KEY` is a name you choose for the host-info service key.
    <br><br>
    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">$ cf create-service-key secondary-node host-info \
           -c '{"replication-request": "host-info" }'<br>
        Creating service key host-info for service instance secondary-node as admin...
        OK
    </pre>

1. View the `replication-credentials` for your host-info service key by running:

    ```
    cf service-key SECONDARY-INSTANCE SERVICE-KEY
    ```
    Where:
    + `SECONDARY-INSTANCE` is the name of the secondary service instance you created in
    step 2 of [Create <%= vars.single_leader_plan %> Service Instances](#create-multi-dc), above.
    + `SERVICE-KEY` is the name of the host-info service key you created in step 1, above.

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">$ cf service-key secondary-node host-info-key <br>
    Getting key host-info-key for service instance secondary-node as admin...

      {
        "replication": {
            "peer-info": {
              "hostname": "secondary.bosh",
              "ip": "10.0.19.12",
              "system_domain": "sys.secondary-domain.com",
              "uuid": "ab12cd34-5678-91e2-345f-67891h234567"
          },
          "role": "leader"
        }
      }</pre>
1. Record the output of the above command.
1. Log in to the deployment for your primary foundation by running:

    ```
    cf login PRIMARY-API-URL
    ```
1. Update your primary service instance with the host-info service key by running:

    ```
    cf update-service PRIMARY-INSTANCE -c HOST-INFO
    ```
    Where:
    + `PRIMARY-INSTANCE` is the name of the primary service instance you created in
    step 1 of [Create <%= vars.single_leader_plan %> Service Instances](#create-multi-dc), above.
    + `HOST-INFO` is the output you recorded in step 3, above.

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">$ cf update-service primary-node -c {"replication":{ \
      "peer-info":{ \
          "hostname": "secondary.bosh", \
          "ip": "10.0.18.12", \
          "system_domain": "sys.secondary-domain.com", \
          "uuid": "ab12cd34-5678-91e2-345f-67891h234567" \
        },\
      "role": "leader" \
      } \
    }<br>
    Updating service instance primary-node as admin...
    OK</pre>
1.  Create a credentials service key for the service instance in your primary foundation by
    running:

    ```
    cf create-service-key PRIMARY-INSTANCE SERVICE-KEY-NAME \
      -c '{"replication-request": "credentials"}
    ```
    Where:
    + `PRIMARY-INSTANCE` is the name of the primary service instance you created in
    step 1 of [Create <%= vars.single_leader_plan %> Service Instances](#create-multi-dc), above.
    + `SERVICE-KEY-NAME` is a name you choose for the credentials service key.
    <br><br>
    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">$ cf create-service-key primary-node cred-key \
          -c '{"replication-request": "credentials" }' <br>
      Creating service key cred-key for service instance primary-node as admin...
      OK
    </pre>
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The <code>-c </code> flag is different than the one in step 1.
    </p>
1. View the `replication-credentials` for your credentials service key by running:

    ```
    cf service-key PRIMARY-INSTANCE SERVICE-KEY-NAME
    ```
    Where:
    + `PRIMARY-INSTANCE` is the name of the primary service instance you created in step 1
    of [Create <%= vars.single_leader_plan %> Service Instances](#create-multi-dc), above.
    + `SERVICE-KEY-NAME` is the name of the credentials service key you created in step 6, above.

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">$ cf service-key primary-node cred-key <br>
    Getting key cred-key for service instance primary as admin...

      {
        "replication": {
          "credentials": {
            "password": "a22aaa2a2a2aaaaa",
            "username": "6bf07ae455a14064a9073cec8696366c"
          },
          "peer-info": {
            "hostname": "primary.bosh",
            "ip": "10.0.17.12",
            "system_domain": "sys.primary-domain.com",
            "uuid": "zy98xw76-5432-19v8-765u-43219t876543"
          },
          "role": "follower"
        }
      }</pre>

1. Record the output of the above command.
1. Log in to the deployment for your secondary foundation by running:

    ```
    cf login SECONDARY-API-URL
    ```
1. Update your secondary service instance with the credentials service key by running:

    ```
    cf update-service SECONDARY-INSTANCE -c CREDENTIALS
    ```
    Where:
    + `SECONDARY-INSTANCE` is name of the secondary service instance you created in step 2 of
    [Create <%= vars.single_leader_plan %> Service Instances](#create-multi-dc), above.
    + `CREDENTIALS` is the output you recorded in step 8, above.

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">$ cf update-service secondary-node -c {"replication": { \
        "credentials": { \
          "password": "a22aaa2a2a2aaaaa", \
          "username": "6bf07ae455a14064a9073cec8696366c" \
        }, \
        "peer-info": { \
          "hostname": "primary.bosh", \
          "ip": "10.0.17.12", \
          "system_domain": "sys.primary-domain.com", \
          "uuid": "zy98xw76-5432-19v8-765u-43219t876543" \
        }, \
        "role": "follower" \
      } \
    }<br>
    Updating service instance primary-node as admin...
    OK</pre>

### <a id='bind'></a>Bind a Leader-Follower Service Instance to Your App

For an app to use a multi-site leader-follower service instance, you must bind your app to
your primary service instance in your primary foundation. If you want to use an active-active topology,
you must additionally bind your app to the secondary service instance in your secondary foundation.

For information about apps in multiple foundations or data centers, see
[About <%= vars.single_leader_plan %>](./about-multi-site.html).

To bind an app to a leader-follower service instance:

1. Log in to the deployment for your primary foundation by running:

    ```
    cf login PRIMARY-API-URL
    ```
1. Bind your app to your primary service instance by doing the procedure in
[Bind a Service Instance to Your App](./use.html#bind).

1. (Optional) If you are using an active-active topology,
you must bind the same app to your secondary service instance in your secondary foundation.
To do this, repeat the above steps and replace references to `primary` with `secondary`.

1. Modify your app to use the <%= vars.product_name %> service by doing the procedure in
  [Use the MySQL Service in Your App](./use.html#call).
