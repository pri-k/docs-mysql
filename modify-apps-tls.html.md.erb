title: Modifying Apps for TLS
owner: MySQL
---

This topic describes how developers can modify their apps to use TLS to secure their connection with the MySQL for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) v2 service.

If your app is written in Java or Spring, see [Activate TLS for Java and Spring Apps](using-tls.html#activate-tls). Otherwise, perform the procedures below.

##<a id='prereqs'></a> Prerequisites

The procedures in this topic have the following prerequisites:

* To use TLS with your apps, the PCF operator must have completed the procedures in [Preparing for TLS](prepare-tls.html) and enabled TLS in the tile configuration when performing the steps in [Installing and Configuring MySQL for PCF](install-config.html).
* The developer must have completed the procedures in [Enable TLS](using-tls.html#enable-tls) to enable TLS for an existing service instance.

##<a id='modify'></a> Modify Your App for TLS

In order to activate TLS for apps not written in Java or Spring,
you must modify them to discover the CA certificate in `VCAP_SERVICES`
and specify that CA component when initiating the connection to the data service.

`VCAP_SERVICES` is an environment variable that exists within every container.
It contains runtime-specific information about the app, including metadata supplied by each of the services that have been bound to that app.
The metadata includes the information necessary to connect to the service, such as hostnames, usernames, and passwords.

Your app must perform the following tasks:

1. Retrieve the hostname, username, password, database name, and CA certificate
   for the bound MySQL for PCF service instance from the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable.
1. Use the hostname, username, password, and CA certificate to establish a secure connection with the bound MySQL for PCF service instance.

For example, the following Node.js code initializes a variable named `mysql_creds`, and then populates it with the necessary information from `VCAP_SERVICES`:

```js
var mysql_creds = {} ;
var vcap_services = undefined ;

if (process.env.VCAP_SERVICES) {
    vcap_services = JSON.parse(process.env.VCAP_SERVICES) ;
    mysql_creds["host"] = vcap_services["p.mysql"][0]["credentials"]["hostname"] ;
    mysql_creds["user"] = vcap_services["p.mysql"][0]["credentials"]["username"] ;
    mysql_creds["password"] = vcap_services["p.mysql"][0]["credentials"]["password"] ;
    mysql_creds["port"] = vcap_services["p.mysql"][0]["credentials"]["port"] ;
    mysql_creds["database"] = vcap_services["p.mysql"][0]["credentials"]["name"] ;
    if (vcap_services["p.mysql"][0]["credentials"]["tls"]) {
        mysql_creds["ca_certificate"] = vcap_services["p.mysql"][0]["credentials"]["tls"]["cert"]["ca"];
    } else {
        mysql_creds["ca_certificate"] = undefined ;
    }
}
```

The following Node.js function establishes a TLS connection with the MySQL service, using the information loaded into `mysql_creds`:

```js
function MySQLConnect() {
    clientConfig = {
        host : mysql_creds["host"],
        user : mysql_creds["user"],
        password : mysql_creds["password"],
        port : mysql_creds["port"],
        database : mysql_creds["database"]
    } ;
    if (mysql_creds["ca_certificate"]) {
        clientConfig["ssl"] = { ca : mysql_creds["ca_certificate"] } ;
    }
    dbClient = mysql.createConnection( clientConfig ) ;
    dbClient.connect(CALLBACK-FUNCTION) ;
}
```

##<a id='repush-rebind'></a> Repush or Rebind Your App

After modifying your app, repush it with `cf push`. 

If you app is bound to an existing service instance, you must re-bind it after enabling TLS for the instance.
Perform the following steps:

1. Stop the app. For example:
    <pre class="terminal">$ cf stop my-app</pre>
1. Unbind the app from the service instance. For example:
    <pre class="terminal">$ cf unbind-service my-app my-service-instance</pre>
1. Re-bind the app to the service instance. For example:
    <pre class="terminal">$ cf bind-service my-app my-service-instance</pre>
1. Restage the app. For example:
    <pre class="terminal">$ cf restage my-app</pre>

Your app should now communicate securely with the MySQL service instance.
