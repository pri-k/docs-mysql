This topic describes the significant features in MySQL for PCF v2.
This topic also presents a checklist that you can use to decide if MySQL for PCF is ready to meet your business requirements.

##<a id="intro"></a> Introduction

MySQL for PCF v2 introduces the On-Demand Service, which provides dedicated instances of
MySQL that App Developers can provision on-demand from the command line.
The MySQL for PCF On-Demand service is designed to improve the flexibility in how and when
instances are provisioned and allows for more efficient and seamless resource use for both Operator and App Developer.
Additionally, both Operator and App Developer can configure essential MySQL settings.
MySQL for PCF v2 can be installed alongside the earlier MySQL for PCF v1.x tiles.

MySQL for PCF's On-Demand Service leverages the [on-demand service broker](https://docs.pivotal.io/svc-sdk/odb/0-15/).

## <a id="service"></a>On Demand Service Plan Descriptions

PCF MySQL offers five on-demand plans as the `p.mysql` service within the PCF MySQL tile.
The plans can be configured in any way that you see fit.
However, plans should be configured such that they increase in size.

For each service plan, the operator can configure the **Multi-Node**, **Plan name**, **Plan description**, **Server VM type** and **Server Disk type**, or choose to disable the plan completely.

Operators can update certain plan settings after the plans have been created.
If the Operator updates the VM size or disk size these settings will be implemented in all instances already created.
Operators should not downsize the VMs or disk size as this can cause data loss in pre-existing instances.

##<a id="tls"></a> Transport Layer Security (TLS)

In MySQL for PCF v2.3 and later, you can enable TLS. 
Enabling TLS provisions a MySQL server with a certificate so 
that apps and clients can establish an encrypted connection with the data service.

For more information on TLS, and the workflow for enabling and using it, see [Preparing for TLS](./prepare-tls.html).

## <a id="other-notes"></a>About Multiple AZs in MySQL for PCF v2

MySQL for PCF v2 supports configuring multiple AZs.
However, assigning multiple AZs to MySQL jobs does not guarantee high availability.

* On-Demand plans can be assigned to any of the configured availability zones. 
* You can select two AZs
  for the multi-node plans to increase the availability. 
  Choosing three AZs for multi-node plans does not increase the number of AZs assigned to three.
* You can select one AZ for the single-node plan.
  Choosing two AZs for the single-node plan does not increase the number of AZs assigned to two.
