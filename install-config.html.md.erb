<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>


This topic provides instructions to <%= vars.platform_name %> operators
about how to install, configure, and deploy the <%= vars.product_full %> tile.  The
<%= vars.product_short %> service enables <%= vars.platform_name %> developers to create and use MySQL
service instances on demand.

## <a id="rbac"></a>Role-Based Access in <%= vars.ops_manager_full %>

<%= vars.ops_manager %> admins can use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage which
operators can make deployment changes, view credentials, and manage user roles in <%= vars.ops_manager %>.
Your role permissions might not permit you to do every procedure in this topic.

For more information about roles in <%= vars.ops_manager %>, see
    <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/opsguide/config-rbac.html#about">
        Roles in <%= vars.ops_manager %></a>.</p>

## <a id="prereq"></a> Prerequisites

Before you install the <%= vars.product_short %> tile, you must:

+ [Create an App Security Group for <%= vars.product_short %>](#asg).
+ [Enable the BOSH Resurrector](#resurrector).
+ [(Optional) Preparing for TLS](prepare-tls.html). Only required if you want to enable TLS.

### <a id="asg"></a> Create an App Security Group for <%= vars.product_short %>

To enable apps running on <%= vars.platform_name %> to communicate with the MySQL service network,
you must create an App Security Group (ASG).
The ASG enables smoke tests to run when you first install the <%= vars.product_short %> service
and apps to access the service after it is installed.

To create an ASG for <%= vars.product_short %>:

1. Navigate to **<%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard** > **BOSH Director**.

1. Click **Create Networks**.

1. Click your services network and record the **CIDR**.
    ![Reserved IP Ranges](opsman-dir-reserved-ips.png)

1. Create a JSON file named `mysql-asg.json` using the template below:

    ```json
    [
      {
        "protocol": "tcp",
        "destination": "CIDR",
        "ports": "3306"
      }
    ]
    ```
    Where `CIDR` is the CIDR that you recorded in the above step.

1. Create an ASG by running:

    ```
    $ cf create-security-group p.mysql ./mysql-asg.json
    ```

1. Bind the ASG to all running apps by running:

     ```
    $ cf bind-running-security-group p.mysql
    ```

For more information about ASGs,
see [App Security Groups](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/concepts/asg.html#asg-individual).


### <a id="resurrector"></a> Enable the BOSH Resurrector

Pivotal recommends enabling the BOSH Resurrector when installing <%= vars.product_short %>.
The BOSH Resurrector increases the availability of <%= vars.product_short %> by restarting and resuming MySQL service.

The BOSH Resurrector does the following:

- Reacts to hardware failures and network disruptions by restarting VMs on active, stable hosts
- Detects operating system failures by continuously monitoring VMs and restarting them as required
- Continuously monitors the BOSH Agent running on each service instance VM and restarts the VM as required

For more information about the BOSH Resurrector,
see [BOSH Resurrector](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/resurrector.html#bosh-resurrector).

 To enable the BOSH Resurrector:

1. Navigate to **<%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard** > **BOSH Director**.

2. Click **Director Config**.

3. Select the **Enable VM Resurrector Plugin** checkbox.

4. Click **Save**.

## <a id="install"></a> Download and Import the Tile

To download and import the <%= vars.product_short %> tile:

1. Download the product file from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-mysql/).

1. Navigate to the **<%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard** and click **Import a Product** to upload the product file.

1. Under **Import a Product**, click **+** next to the version number of <%= vars.product_short %>.
   This adds the tile to your staging area.

1. Click the newly-added **<%= vars.product_short %>** tile to open its configuration panes.

    ![AZ and Network Assignments pane](config-azs.png)

## <a id="config-on-demand"></a> Configure the Tile

To configure the <%= vars.product_short %> tile, do the procedures below.

###<a id="azs"></a> Configure AZs and Networks

To configure an availability zone (AZ) to run the service broker
and networks for the broker and MySQL service instances:

1. Click **Assign AZs and Networks**.

1. Configure the fields as follows:
  <table>
    <tr><th>Field</th><th>Instructions</th></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Place singleton jobs in</strong></td>
        <td>Select the AZ that you want the MySQL broker VM to run in. The broker runs as a singleton job.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Balance other jobs in</strong></td>
        <td>Ignore; not used.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Network</strong></td>
        <td>Select a subnet for the MySQL broker. This is typically the same subnet
            that includes the <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>) component VMs.<br>
            This network is represented by the Default Network in diagram in <a href="./about.html#on-demand">Default Network and Service Network</a>.
            </td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Service Network</strong></td>
        <td>Select the subnet for the on-demand service instances.
          This network is represented by the Service Network in diagram in <a href="./about.html#on-demand">Default Network and Service Network</a>.
            <br><br>
            If you are adding IPsec to encrypt MySQL communication, Pivotal recommends that you deploy MySQL to its own network
            to avoid conflicts with services that are not IPsec compatible.
         </td></tr>
  </table>
    <p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> You cannot change the regions or networks
    after you <strong>Apply Changes</strong>.
  </p>

1. Click **Save**.

###<a id="active"></a> Configure Service Plans

<%= partial vars.path_to_partials + "/mysql/galera_ga" %>
<%= partial '../../p-mysql/partials/mysql/multi_site_beta' %>

<%= vars.product_short %> enables you to configure as many as nine service plans.
Each service plan has a corresponding section in the tile configuration, such as **Plan 1**, **Plan 2**, and so on.

By default, plans 1–3 are active and plans 4–9 are inactive. The procedures below describe how to change these defaults.

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong>
  You must not set <strong>Plan 1</strong> to <strong>Inactive</strong>.
  If you deactivate <strong>Plan 1</strong>, your installation fails when you apply changes.
</p>

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> You must configure one of your service plans as
a single node plan. This is because you can only restore to a single node plan. You cannot restore
directly to a leader-follower plan. Ensure that the persistent disk in the single node plan is as
least as large as the persistent disk of your largest leader-follower plan.
For more information about restoring services instances,
see <a href="./backup-and-restore.html#restoreinstance">Restore the Service Instance</a>.
</p>

For each plan that you want to use in your <%= vars.platform_name %> deployment:

1. Click the section for the plan. For example, **Plan 1**.

1. Select the plan for your desired topology.

###<a id="backups"></a> Configure Backups

To configure automated backups:

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> You must configure automated backups. Automated backups can no longer be disabled.</p>

1. Click **Backups**.

    <%= image_tag("backups.png", :alt => "The radio buttons for backup configuration are
        Ceph or Amazon S3, SCP, GCS, and Azure.", :width => "200") %>

1. To learn how automated backups work, see [About Automated Backups](backup-and-restore.html#overview).

1. Select a **Backup configuration** and do the procedure for your storage solution in _Backing Up and Restoring_:
  * **Ceph or Amazon S3:** <%= vars.product_short %> runs an [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/s3/) client
    that saves backups to an S3 bucket,
    a [Ceph](http://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/) storage cluster, or another S3-compatible endpoint certified by Pivotal.<br>
    For instructions about using Ceph or Amazon S3 for backups, see [Back up to Ceph or S3](./backup-and-restore.html#ceph-or-s3).<br><br>
  * **SCP:** <%= vars.product_short %> runs an Secure Copy Protocol (SCP) command that secure-copies backups to a VM
    or physical machine operating outside of <%= vars.platform_name %>. This is the fastest option. <br>
    SCP enables you to securely transfer files between two hosts.
    You can provision the backup machine separately from your <%= vars.platform_name %> installation.
     <br>For instructions about using SCP for backups, see [Back up with SCP](backup-and-restore.html#scp).<br><br>
  * **GSC:** <%= vars.product_short %> runs a [Google Cloud Storage (GCS)](https://cloud.google.com/storage/) SDK
    that saves backups to an GCS bucket. <br>For instructions about using GCS for backups, see [Back up to GCS](backup-and-restore.html#gcs). <br><br>
  * **Azure:** <%= vars.product_short %> runs an [Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/)
    SDK that saves backups to an Azure storage account.<br>For instructions about using Azure for backups, see [Back up to Azure Storage](backup-and-restore.html#azure).

###<a id="security"></a> Configure Security

To configure the security settings for the MySQL service, do one or both:

* Enable TLS for the MySQL service. See [Configure TLS](#security-tls) below.
* Store your service instance credentials in runtime CredHub. See [Configure Secure Service Instance Credentials](#security-service-instance-creds) below.

![security](security.png)

####<a id="security-tls"></a> Configure TLS

To enable TLS for the MySQL service:


1. Do the procedures in [Preparing for TLS](prepare-tls.html).

1. Click **Security**.
1. Under **TLS Options**, select one of the following:
  *  **Optional**: This enables developers to configure their MySQL service VMs to use TLS.
  * **Required**: This enables developers to configure their MySQL service VMs to use TLS and requires all MySQL service VMs to only accept secure connections.
<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> Selecting <strong>Required</strong> breaks any apps that are not currently connecting over TLS.</p>
1. Click **Save**.
1. After deploying the tile, notify your developers that they must enable TLS for their service instances and activate TLS for their apps.
See [Using TLS](using-tls.html).

####<a id="security-service-instance-creds"></a> Configure Secure Service Instance Credentials

You can store your service instance credentials in runtime CredHub instead of the Cloud Controller database (CCDB).
For more information about runtime CredHub, see [CredHub](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/credhub/).

To store your service instance credentials in runtime CredHub:

1. Ensure that you have configured the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile to support securing service instance credentials in runtime CredHub.
   For instructions, see [Step 1: Configure the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> Tile](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/opsguide/secure-si-creds.html#pas-config).
1. Click **Security**.
1. Select the **Enable Secure Service Instance Credentials** checkbox.
1. Click **Save**.
1. After deploying the tile, notify the developers that they must unbind and rebind any existing service instances bindings if they want to use secure service instance credentials. Developers must:

    1. Unbind the service instance from the app by running:

        ```
        cf unbind-service APP SERVICE-INSTANCE
        ```
    1. Rebind the service instance to the app by running:

        ```
        cf bind-service PP SERVICE-INSTANCE
        ```
    1. Restart the app to apply the new binding by running:

        ```
        cf restart APP
        ```
    1. Verify that the binding includes CredHub pointers in the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable by running:

        ```
        cf env APP
        ```
        For example:
        <pre class="terminal">$ cf env my-app
        Getting env variables for app my-app in org system / space example as admin...
        OK
        System-Provided:

###<a id="service-instance-upgrades"></a> Configure Service Instance Upgrades

This section configures the `upgrade-all-service-instances` errand.
<%= vars.product_short %> uses this errand to upgrade service instances.

To configure service instance upgrades.

1. Click **Service Instance Upgrades**.

    <%= image_tag("service-instance-upgrades.png", :alt => "Screenshot of service instance upgrades section in the MySQL tile in Ops Manager. Includes a header called 'Configuration for the upgrade-all-service-instances errand and several fields, described below. ") %>

1. Configure the fields as follows:
  <table>
    <tr><th>Field</th><th>Instructions</th></tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>Number of simultaneous upgrades</strong></td>
        <td>Enter the maximum number of service instances that can upgrade at the same time.
        The minimum value is 0 and the maximum is 1 less than the number of BOSH workers. Increasing this value reduces the runtime of service instance upgrades.
        <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> To determine the number of BOSH workers, navigate to <strong>BOSH Director</strong> > <strong>Director Config</strong> and locate the value of <strong>Director Workers</strong>.
        </p>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Number of upgrade canary instances</td>
        <td>Enter the number of service instances to upgrade first before upgrading the rest of the instances.
            Increasing this value enables service instance upgrades to fail faster.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr><td><strong>BOSH Upgrade Timeout</td>
        <td>Enter the amount of time in seconds to wait for BOSH to respond before timing out when upgrading service instances.
            Increasing this value enables service instance upgrades to fail faster.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <strong>Please type 'X' to acknowledge that you have run...</strong>

###<a id="errands"></a> (Optional) Review Errands

Errands are scripts that run at specfic times to do various tasks.
<%= vars.product_short %> can run errands to manage the broker and service instances.
You do not need to change the default configurations for errands.

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> The <strong>Delete All Service Instances and Deregister Broker</strong> errand does
necessary cleanup tasks when you delete the <%= vars.product_short %> tile or re-define plans. Setting this errand to <strong>Off</strong> can cause
problems when attempting to reinstall the tile or re-define plans. Pivotal recommends that you do not set this errand to <strong>Off</strong>.
</p>

<%= vars.product_short %> uses the following types of errands:


* **Post-Deploy Errands:** These errands run when you click **Apply Changes**.
* **Pre-Delete Errands:** These errands run before you delete the <%= vars.product_short %> tile.

<%= vars.product_short %> also uses errands to configure leader-follower service instances.
For more information about leader-follower errands, see <a href="./maintain-leader-follower.html#errands">Errands Used in Leader-Follower Failover</a>.

You can use errands when troubleshooting the broker or service instances.
For more information about using errands for troubleshooting, see [Run Service
Broker Errands to Manage Brokers and Instances](./troubleshoot.html#broker-errands).
