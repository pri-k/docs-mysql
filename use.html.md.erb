title: Using MySQL for PCF v2
owner: MySQL
---

This topic provides instructions for developers using the MySQL for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) v2 service for their
PCF apps. MySQL provides a relational database for apps and devices.

These procedures use the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI). For more information,
see [Managing Service Instances with the cf CLI](http://docs.pivotal.io/devguide/services/managing-services.html).

You can also use [Apps Manager](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/console/dev-console.html) to do the same tasks using a graphical UI.


## <a id="prereqs"></a>Prerequisites

To use MySQL for PCF v2 with your PCF apps, you need:

* A PCF installation with [MySQL for PCF](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-mysql) installed and listed
in the [Marketplace](http://docs.pivotal.io/devguide/services/#instances)
* A [Space Developer](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/concepts/roles.html#roles) or Admin account on the PCF installation
* A local machine with the following installed:
   - a browser
   - a shell
   - the [Cloud Foundry Command-Line Interface](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html) (cf CLI)
   - the Linux [watch](http://www.linfo.org/watch.html) command
* To [log in to](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/cf-cli/getting-started.html#login) the org and space containing your app


## <a id='process'></a>The Process for Using MySQL for PCF in Your App

To use MySQL in a PCF app:

1. Check the service availability in the Marketplace,
   and see if there is an existing instance of MySQL for PCF in your space.

    See [Confirm the MySQL for PCF v2 Service Availability](#marketplace), below.

2. If there is no existing instance or you want to use a different one,
   create an instance of the MySQL for PCF service in the same space as the app.

    See [Create a Service Instance](#create), below.

3. Push your app into the same space as the MySQL for PCF service instance,
   using `cf push`.

    For information about `cf push`,
   see [Push](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-0/cf-cli/getting-started.html#push).

4. Bind the app to the MySQL for PCF service instance, to enable the app to use MySQL.

    See [Bind a Service Instance to Your App](#bind), below.

5. Call the MySQL for PCF service in your app code, and then re-push your app into the space.

    See [Use the MySQL Service in Your App](#call), below.



## <a id='marketplace'></a>Confirm the MySQL for PCF v2 Service Availability

For an app to use the MySQL for PCF v2 service, both of the following must be true:

* The service must be available in the Marketplace for its space.
* An instance of the service must exist in its space.

You can confirm both of these using the cf CLI as follows.

### <a id="check-marketplace"></a> Check Service Availability in the Marketplace

To find out if a MySQL for PCF v2 service is available in the Marketplace, do the following:

1. Enter the following command:

    ```
    cf marketplace
    ```

1. If the output lists `p.mysql` in the `service` column, MySQL for PCF v2 is available.
   If it is not available, ask your operator to install it.

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf marketplace
    Getting services from marketplace in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
    OK
    service             plans          description
    [...]
    p.mysql             db-small       Dedicated instances of MySQL service to provide a relational database
    [...]
    </pre>

### <a id="check-instance"></a> Check That an Instance Is Running in the Space

To confirm that a MySQL for PCF v2 instance is running in the space, do the following:

1. Use the [cf CLI](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/cf-cli/getting-started.html#login) or
[Apps Manager](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/console-login.html) to log in to the org and space that contains the app.
1. Enter the following command:

    ```
    cf services
    ```
1. Any `p.mysql` listings in the `service` column are service instances of MySQL for PCF v2 in the space.
<br><br>
For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf services
    Getting services in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
    OK
    name          service     plan        bound apps    last operation
    my-instance   p.mysql     db-small                  create succeeded
    </pre>
    You can [bind](#bind) your app to an existing instance or [create](#create) a new instance to bind to your app.

## <a id='create'></a>Create a Service Instance

Unlike pre-provisioned services, on-demand services are created asynchronously, not immediately.
The `watch` command shows you when your service instance is ready to bind and use.

To create an instance of the MySQL for PCF v2 service, do the following:

1. Run the following command:

    ```
    cf create-service p.mysql PLAN SERVICE-INSTANCE`<br><br>
    ```

    Where:<br>
    - `PLAN` is the name of the MySQL for PCF v2 plan you want to use.
    - `SERVICE-INSTANCE` is a name you choose to identify the service instance.
    This name appears under `service` in output from `cf services`.

1. Enter the following command and wait for the `last operation` for
your instance to show as `create succeeded`.

    ```
    watch cf services
    ```

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
   $ cf create-service p.mysql db-small my-instance<br>
    Creating service my-instance in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
    OK<br>
   $ watch cf services<br>
    Getting services in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
    OK
    name          service       plan        bound apps    last operation
    my-instance   p.mysql       db-small                  create succeeded
</pre>

    If you get an error, see [Troubleshooting Instances](./troubleshoot-instances.html).

## <a id="bind"></a>Bind a Service Instance to Your App

For an app to use a service, you must bind the app to a service instance. Do this after you push or re-push the app using `cf push`.

To bind an app to a MySQL for PCF instance run the following command:

```
cf bind-service APP SERVICE-INSTANCE
```

Where:<br>

- `APP` is the app you want to use the MySQL service instance.<br>
- `SERVICE-INSTANCE` is the name you supplied when you ran `cf create-service`.

For example:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf bind-service my-app my-instance<br>
Binding service mydb to my-app in org my-org / space test as user<span>@</span>example.com...
OK
TIP: Use 'cf push' to ensure your env variable changes take effect
</pre>

## <a id="call"></a>Use the MySQL Service in Your App

To modify your app code to access and use the MySQL service, do the following:

1. Verify that your app code can retry in the case of DNS timeouts.

1. Run the following command:

    ```
    cf env APP-NAME
    ```

    Where `APP-NAME` is the name of the app bound to the MySQL for PCF instance.

1. In the output, note the connection strings listed in the `VCAP_SERVICES` > `credentials` object for the app.

1. In your app code, call the MySQL service using the connection strings.<br><br>
  See this example [Node.js code](./modify-apps-tls.html#call-service).


## <a id="manage"></a> Manage Service Instances

This section describes tasks you do over the life cycle of your apps and data:

+ Moving your data to a different plan.
+ Removing an app's access to a service it no longer needs.
+ Deleting a service instance that is not used.

### <a id="update"></a>Update a Service Instance to a Larger Plan

As apps and their databases grow, it may be necessary to update the service instance to a larger plan.
This does not require a rebinding of your app. However, while the instance is being migrated to a new service instance,
the database will be unavailable for several minutes.

To update a service instance to a larger plan, run the following command:

```
cf update-service SERVICE-INSTANCE -p PLAN
```

Where `PLAN` is the plan you want to upgrade the service instance to.

For example:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf update-service my-instance -p db-large
</pre>


### <a id="unbind"></a>Unbind an App from a Service Instance

To stop an app from using a service it no longer needs, run the following command to unbind the app from the service:

```
cf unbind-service APP SERVICE-INSTANCE
```

Where:<br>

- `APP` is the app you want to stop using the MySQL service instance. <br>
- `SERVICE-INSTANCE` is the name you supplied when you ran `cf create-service`.

For example:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf unbind-service my-app my-instance<br>
Unbinding app my-app from service my-instance in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
OK
</pre>

### <a id="delete"></a>Delete a Service Instance

You cannot delete a service instance that an app is bound to.

To delete a service instance, do the following:

1. Run the following command:

    ```
    cf delete-service SERVICE-INSTANCE
    ```

    Where `SERVICE-INSTANCE` is the name of the service to delete.
    <br><br>
    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf delete-service my-instance<br>
    Are you sure you want to delete the service my-instance ? y
    Deleting service my-service in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
    OK
    </pre>

1. Enter the following command and wait for a `Service instance not found` error indicating
that the instance no longer exists:

    ```
    watch cf service SERVICE-INSTANCE
    ```


##<a id='establish-tls'></a> Establish a TLS Connection to a Service Instance

You can use `mysql` to establish a TLS connection to a MySQL for PCF service instance that has TLS enabled. For more information about how to enable TLS for a service instance, see [Using TLS](using-tls.html).

Perform the following steps:

1. Create a new service key for the service instance with TLS enabled. For example:
  <pre class="terminal">$ cf create-service-key my-service-instance my-tls-service-key
  {
   "hostname": "10.1.16.5",
   "jdbcUrl": "jdbc:mysql<span>://</span>10.244.16.3:3306/service\_instance\_db?user=6bf07ae455a14064a9073cec8696366c\u0026password=a22aaa2a2a2aaaaa\u0026=true",
   "name": "service\_instance\_db",
   "password": "a22aaa2a2a2aaaaa",
   "port": 3306,
   "tls": {
    "cert": {
     "ca": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\...n-----END CERTIFICATE-----\n"
    }
   },
   "uri": "mysql<span>://</span>6bf07ae455a14064a9073cec8696366c:a22aaa2a2a2aaaaa<span>@</span>10.244.16.3:3306/service\_instance\_db?reconnect=true",
   "username": "6bf07ae455a14064a9073cec8696366c"
  }
  </pre>
  If the service key does not have a CA certificate under `tls.cert.ca`, the service key may be stale. Create a new one.

1. Copy the contents of the CA certificate under `tls.cert.ca` and paste it into a file. For example:
  <pre class="terminal">$ pbpaste > root.pem</pre>

1. Record the values for `username`, `password`, and `hostname`.

1. Use `mysql` to establish a TLS connection to the MySQL instance.
  Run the following command:
  <pre><code>mysql --host=HOSTNAME \
    --user=USERNAME \
    --password=PASSWORD \
    --ssl-ca=root.pem \
    --ssl-verify-server-cert</code></pre>
  <br>
  Where:
    * `HOSTNAME` is the value for `hostname` retrieved above.
    * `USERNAME` is the value for `username` retrieved above.
    * `PASSWORD` is the value for `password` retrieved above.
  <br><br>
  For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ mysql --hostname=10.1.16.5 \
      --user=6bf07ae455a14064a9073cec8696366c \
      --password=a22aaa2a2a2aaaaa \
      --ssl-ca=root.pem \
      --ssl-verify-server-cert
    </pre>

## <a id="dev-tools"></a>MySQL for PCF Tools

The following tools let developers access their MySQL for PCF databases.

### <a id="mysqlweb"></a>Pivotal MySQLWeb Database Management App

The Pivotal MySQLWeb app provides a web-based UI for managing MySQL for PCF databases.
The free app lets you view and operate on tables, indexes, constraints, and other database structures, and directly execute SQL commands.

![Pivotal MySQLWeb](mysqlweb.png)

You can run the Pivotal MySQLWeb app in two ways:

* Standalone on your own machine
* Deployed to PCF

If you deploy Pivotal MySQLWeb to PCF, you can configure it in the deployment manifest to automatically bind to a specific service instance.

See the Pivotal MySQLWeb [code repo](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/PivotalMySQLWeb) and
[demo video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2wmRcJj8XF-SXloNFNNaGJXbFk/view),
for how to install and run Pivotal MySQLWeb.

### <a id="plugin"></a>cf CLI MySQL Plugin

To connect to your MySQL for PCF databases from a command line, use the cf CLI MySQL plugin.
The plugin lets you:

* Inspect databases for debugging
* Manually adjust database schema or contents in development environments
* Dump and restore databases

To install the cf CLI MySQL plugin, run the following:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf install-plugin -r "CF-Community" mysql-plugin
</pre>

For more information, see the [cf-mysql-plugin](https://github.com/andreasf/cf-mysql-plugin) repository.
