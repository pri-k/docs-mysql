This topic provides instructions for developers using the <%= vars.product_name %> service for their
<%= vars.platform_name %> apps.


## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

<%= vars.product_name %> provides a relational database for apps and devices. To use <%= vars.product_name %> in an app:

1. Check the service availability in the Marketplace,
   and see if there is an existing instance of <%= vars.product_name %> in your space.

    See [Confirm the <%= vars.product_name %> Service Availability](#marketplace), below.

2. If there is no existing instance or you want to use a different one,
   create an instance of the <%= vars.product_name %> service in the same space as the app.

    See [Create a Service Instance](#create), below.

4. Bind the app to the <%= vars.product_name %> service instance, to enable the app to use MySQL.

    See [Bind a Service Instance to Your App](#bind), below.

5. Call the <%= vars.product_name %> service in your app code, and then re-push your app into the space.

    See [Use the MySQL Service in Your App](#call), below.

After you create a <%= vars.product_name %> service instance, you can manage it over the life cycle of your apps and data.
See [Manage Service Instances](#manage), below.

The below procedures use the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI). For more information,
see [Managing Service Instances with the cf CLI](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/services/managing-services.html).
You can also use Apps Manager to do the same tasks using a graphical UI.
For more information, see
[Managing Apps and Service Instances Using Apps Manager](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/console/manage-apps.html)

## <a id="prereqs"></a>Prerequisites

To use <%= vars.product_name %> with your <%= vars.platform_name %> apps, you need:

* Decide what type of plan you want from the following options: single node, leader-follower, highly available (HA) cluster. Your marketplace might not offer all of these types. For about service plans information, see [Availability Options](availability-options.html).
* If you intend to use an HA cluster plan, review the limitations associated with this plan type. See [Highly Available Cluster Limitations](./about-ha.html#limitations).
* A <%= vars.platform_name %> installation with [<%= vars.product_name %>](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-mysql) installed and listed
in the [Marketplace](http://docs.pivotal.io/devguide/services/#instances)
* A [Space Developer](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/concepts/roles.html#roles) or Admin account on the <%= vars.platform_name %> installation
* A local machine with the following installed:
   - a browser
   - a shell
   - the [Cloud Foundry Command-Line Interface](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html) (cf CLI)
   - the Linux [watch](http://www.linfo.org/watch.html) command
* To [log in to](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/cf-cli/getting-started.html#login) the org and space containing your app


## <a id='marketplace'></a>Confirm the <%= vars.product_name %> Service Availability

For an app to use the <%= vars.product_name %> service, both of the following must be true:

* The service must be available in the Marketplace for its space.
* An instance of the service must exist in its space.

You can confirm both of these using the cf CLI as follows.

### <a id="check-marketplace"></a> Check Service Availability in the Marketplace

To find out if a <%= vars.product_name %> service is available in the Marketplace:

1. Enter the following command:

    ```
    cf marketplace
    ```

1. If the output lists `p.mysql` in the `service` column, <%= vars.product_name %> is available.
   If it is not available, ask your operator to install it.

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf marketplace
    Getting services from marketplace in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
    OK
    service             plans          description
    [...]
    p.mysql             db-small       Dedicated instances of MySQL service to provide a relational database
    [...]
    </pre>

### <a id="check-instance"></a> Check That an Instance Is Running in the Space

To confirm that a <%= vars.product_name %> instance is running in the space:

1. Use the [cf CLI](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/cf-cli/getting-started.html#login) or
[Apps Manager](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/console-login.html) to log in to the org and space that contains the app.
1. Enter the following command:

    ```
    cf services
    ```
1. Any `p.mysql` listings in the `service` column are service instances of <%= vars.product_name %> in the space.
<br><br>
For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf services
    Getting services in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
    OK
    name          service     plan        bound apps    last operation
    my-instance   p.mysql     db-small                  create succeeded
    </pre>
    You can [bind](#bind) your app to an existing instance or [create](#create) a new instance to bind to your app.

## <a id='create'></a>Create a Service Instance

On-demand services are created asynchronously, not immediately.
The `watch` command shows you when your service instance is ready to bind and use.

To create an instance of the <%= vars.product_name %> service:

1. Create a service instance by running the following command:

    ```
    cf create-service p.mysql PLAN SERVICE-INSTANCE
    ```

    Where:
    - `PLAN` is the name of the <%= vars.product_name %> plan you want to use.
    - `SERVICE-INSTANCE` is a name you choose to identify the service instance.
    This name appears under `service` in output from `cf services`.

1. Enter the following command and wait for the `last operation` for
your instance to show as `create succeeded`.

    ```
    watch cf services
    ```

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
   $ cf create-service p.mysql db-small my-instance<br>
    Creating service my-instance in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
    OK<br>
   $ watch cf services<br>
    Getting services in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
    OK
    name          service       plan        bound apps    last operation
    my-instance   p.mysql       db-small                  create succeeded
</pre>

    If you get an error, see [Troubleshooting Instances](./troubleshoot-instances.html).

## <a id="bind"></a>Bind a Service Instance to Your App

For an app to use a service, you must bind the app to a service instance.  You must do this after every time you run `cf push`.

To push and bind an app to a <%= vars.product_name %> instance run the following command:

1. Push your app into the same space as your <%= vars.product_name %> service instance by running the following command:

    ```
    cf push
    ```

1. Bind your app to a <%= vars.product_name %> instance by running the following command:

    ```
    cf bind-service APP SERVICE-INSTANCE
    ```

    Where:<br>
    - `APP` is the app you want to use the MySQL service instance.<br>
    - `SERVICE-INSTANCE` is the name you supplied when you ran `cf create-service`.

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf bind-service my-app my-instance<br>
    Binding service mydb to my-app in org my-org / space test as user<span>@</span>example.com...
    OK
    TIP: Use 'cf push' to ensure your env variable changes take effect
    </pre>

1. Restart your app by running the following command:

    ```
    cf restart APP
    ```
    Where `APP` is the app you want to use the MySQL service instance.

## <a id="call"></a>Use the MySQL Service in Your App

To access the MySQL service from your app:

1. Verify that your app code (or the MySQL client library that the app uses) retries in the case of DNS timeouts.

1. Locate the connection strings listed in the
`VCAP_SERVICES` > `credentials` object for your app. For information about `VCAP_SERVICES`, see [MySQL Environment Variables](#vcap) below.

1. In your app code, call the MySQL service using the connection strings.<br><br>
  See this example [Node.js code](./using-tls.html#call-service).


###<a id="schema"></a>Use Custom Schemas

  <%= vars.product_name %> supports multiple custom schemas.
  You can use custom schemas with apps that share a MySQL service instance to isolate app data by schema.
  By default, service bindings use the default schema `service_instance_db`.

  To use custom schemas in your apps:
    
  1. Bind your app to the custom schema by running the following command:
      
      ```
      cf bind-service APP SERVICE-INSTANCE -c '{"schema":"CUSTOM-SCHEMA"}'
      ```
      
    Where:
    - `APP` is the app you want to use the custom schema.
    - `SERVICE-INSTANCE` is the name of your MySQL for PCF service instance.
    - `CUSTOM-SCHEMA` is the name of your custom schema.
    
  1. Restart your app by running the following command:
    
    ```
    cf restart APP
    ```
    Where `APP` is the app you want to use the custom schema.

###<a id="vcap"></a>MySQL Environment Variables
Apps running in <%= vars.platform_name %> gain access to bound service instances
through an environment variable credentials hash called `VCAP_SERVICES`.
This environment variable includes the credentials that apps
use to access service instances.

For example:

```
{
  "p.mysql": [
    {
      "label": "p.mysql",
      "name": "my-instance",
      "plan": "db-medium",
      "provider": null,
      "syslog_drain_url": null,
      "tags": [
        "mysql"
      ],
      "credentials": {
        "hostname": "10.0.0.20",
        "jdbcUrl": "jdbc:mysql://10.0.0.20:3306/service_instance_db?user=fefcbe8360854a18a7994b870e7b0bf5\u0026password=z9z6eskdbs1rhtxt",
        "name": "service_instance_db",
        "password": "z9z6eskdbs1rhtxt",
        "port": 3306,
        "uri": "mysql://fefcbe8360854a18a7994b870e7b0bf5:z9z6eskdbs1rhtxt@10.0.0.20:3306/service_instance_db?reconnect=true",
        "username": "fefcbe8360854a18a7994b870e7b0bf5"
      },
      "volume_mounts": []
    }
  ]
}
```

You can search for your service by the `name` given when the service instance was created.
You can also search using the `tags` or `label` properties.
The `credentials` property can be used to provide access to the MySQL protocol.

`VCAP_SERVICES` is only modified when an app is bound to a service instance.
If you modify your service instance,
you must `cf unbind-service`, `cf bind-service` and `cf restage`
your app to apply the changes to `VCAP_SERVICES`.

## <a id="manage"></a>Manage a Service Instance

You can manage service instances in the following ways:

+ Move your data to a different plan. See [Update a Service Instance to a Larger Plan](#update), below.
+ Share service instances between orgs and spaces. See [Share Service Instances](#share), below.
+ Remove access to a service from an app that no longer needs it. See [Unbind an App from a Service Instance](#unbind), below.
+ Delete a service instance that is not used. See [Delete a Service Instance](#delete), below.

### <a id="update"></a>Update a Service Instance to a Larger Plan

As apps and their databases grow, it might be necessary to update the service instance to a larger plan.
This does not require a rebinding of your app or service keys. However, while the instance is being migrated to a new service instance,
the database is unavailable for several minutes.

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> You cannot update to or from a highly available (HA) cluster plan
  to a plan that uses a single-node or leader-follower topology using the <code>update-service</code> command. To update to or from HA cluster plan, you must migrate your data to a new service instance using the <code>cf mysql-tools</code>  plugin. For more information about migrating data, see <a href="./migrate-data.html">Migrating Data in <%= vars.product_name %></a>.</p>

To update a service instance to a larger plan, run the following command:

```
cf update-service SERVICE-INSTANCE -p PLAN
```

Where `PLAN` is the plan you want to upgrade the service instance to.

For example:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf update-service my-instance -p db-large
</pre>

###<a id="share"></a> Share Service Instances

In <%= vars.product_name %> you can share service instances between different orgs and spaces using `cf share-service`.
Service instance sharing is enabled by default.

For more information about service instance sharing, see [Sharing Service Instances](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/application-service/devguide/services/sharing-instances.html).

To share a service instance:

1. Target the source org and space for the service instance you want to share by running:
  
    ```
    cf target -o SOURCE-ORG -s SOURCE-SPACE
    ```
    
    Where:
    + `SOURCE-ORG` is the source org for your service instance.
    + `SOURCE-SPACE` is the source space for your service instance. 
    
2. Share your service instance to the destination org and space by running:

    ```
    cf share-service SERVICE-INSTANCE -o DESTINATION-ORG -s DESTINATION-SPACE
    ```
    
    Where:
    + `SERVICE-INSTANCE` is the service instance you want to share. 
    + `DESTINATION-ORG` is the destination org for the service instance.
    + `DESTINATION-SPACE` is the destination space for the service instance.
1. Target the destination org and space by running:

    ```
    cf target -o DESTINATION-ORG -s DESTINATION-SPACE
    ```
  
1. Confirm the service instance was shared by running: 

    ```
    cf service SERVICE-INSTANCE
    ```
    
    Where `SERVICE-INSTANCE` is the service instance you shared. 

### <a id="unbind"></a>Unbind an App from a Service Instance

To stop an app from using a service it no longer needs, run the following command to unbind the app from the service:

```
cf unbind-service APP SERVICE-INSTANCE
```

Where:<br>

- `APP` is the app you want to stop using the MySQL service instance. <br>
- `SERVICE-INSTANCE` is the name you supplied when you ran `cf create-service`.

For example:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf unbind-service my-app my-instance<br>
Unbinding app my-app from service my-instance in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
OK
</pre>

### <a id="delete"></a>Delete a Service Instance

You cannot delete a service instance that an app is bound to.

To delete a service instance:

1. Run the following command:

    ```
    cf delete-service SERVICE-INSTANCE
    ```

    Where `SERVICE-INSTANCE` is the name of the service to delete.
    <br><br>
    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf delete-service my-instance<br>
    Are you sure you want to delete the service my-instance ? y
    Deleting service my-service in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
    OK
    </pre>

1. Enter the following command and wait for a `Service instance not found` error indicating
that the instance no longer exists:

    ```
    watch cf service SERVICE-INSTANCE
    ```
