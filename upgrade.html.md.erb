This topic explains how to upgrade the MySQL for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) service and existing service instances.
It also explains the service interruptions that can result from service changes and upgrades and from failures at the process, VM, and IaaS level.

## <a id="upgrade-service"></a>Upgrade MySQL for PCF

To upgrade the MySQL for PCF service, follow the <%= vars.ops_manager %> process that you use to install the service for the first time.
Your configuration settings migrate to the new version automatically. To perform an upgrade:

1. Review the [Release Notes](./release-notes.html) for the version you are upgrading to.

1. Download the Ubuntu Xenial stemcell from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/stemcells-ubuntu-xenial),
and import it into the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Stemcell Library. For instructions, see [Verify Stemcell Version and Apply All Changes](./install-config.html#stemcell).

1. Download the desired version of the product from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-mysql).

1. Navigate to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard and click **Import a Product** to upload the product file.

1. Under the **Import a Product** button, click **+** next to **MySQL for PCF**. This adds the tile to your staging area.

1. Click the newly-added **MySQL for PCF** tile to review its configuration panes.
Click **Save** on any panes where you make changes.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> To decrease the runtime for service instance upgrades,
      configure the <code>upgrade-all-service-instances</code> errand in the tile.
      For instructions about configuring this errand,
      see <a href="./install-config.html#service-instance-upgrades">Configure Service Instance Upgrades</a>.

1. Return to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Dashboard and do the following to complete the installation:

    1. Click **Review Pending Changes**.
    For more information about this <%= vars.ops_manager %> page, see
    [Reviewing Pending Product Changes](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/review-pending-changes.html).<br><br>
    1. Click **Apply Changes**.

1. After the upgrade completes, upgrade all of the MySQL service instances to the new version,
as described in [Upgrade MySQL Instances](#upgrade-instances) below.

Upgrading the MySQL for PCF service and service instances can temporarily interrupt
the service.
For more information, see [Service Interruptions](#interruptions) below.

## <a id="upgrade-instances"></a>Upgrade MySQL Instances

After upgrading the MySQL for PCF service, operators must upgrade existing service instances
to run the new version of the service.
Developers cannot create new bindings to a service instance that has not been upgraded.

To upgrade existing service instances, operators run the following command:

```
bosh -d BROKER-NAME run-errand upgrade-all-service-instances
```

Where `BROKER-NAME` is the deployment name of the broker.

For more information about the `upgrade-all-service-instances` errand, see [upgrade-all-service-instances](./errands.html#upgrade-all-service-instances).

## <a id="interruptions"></a>Service Interruptions

Service changes and upgrades and failures at the process, VM, and IaaS level can cause outages in the MySQL for PCF service, as described below.

Read this section if:

+ You are experiencing a service interruption and are wondering why.
+ You are planning to update or change a service instance and want to know if it might cause a service interruption.

### <a id='service-update'></a>Stemcell or Service Update

An operator updates a stemcell version or their version of MySQL for PCF.

- <strong>Impact:</strong> Apps lose access to the MySQL service while PCF updates the service instance they are bound to.
          The service should resume within 10–15 minutes.
- <strong>Required Actions:</strong> None. If the update deploys successfully, apps reconnect automatically.

### <a id='change-plan'></a>Plan Change

A developer changes their service instance to provide a different service plan, using `cf update-service` or Apps Manager.

- <strong>Impact:</strong> Apps lose access to the MySQL service while PCF updates the service instance they are bound to.
          The service should resume within 10–15 minutes.
- <strong>Required Actions:</strong> None. If the plan change deploys successfully, apps reconnect automatically.
