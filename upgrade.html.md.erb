This topic explains how to upgrade the <%= vars.product_full %> service and existing service instances.
It also explains the service interruptions that can result from service changes and upgrades and from failures at the process, VM, and IaaS level.

## <a id="upgrade-service"></a>Upgrade <%= vars.product_short %>

To upgrade the <%= vars.product_short %> service, follow the <%= vars.ops_manager_full %> process that you use to install the service for the first time.
Your configuration settings migrate to the new version automatically. To perform an upgrade:

1. Review the [Release Notes](./release-notes.html) for the version you are upgrading to.

1. Download the Ubuntu Xenial stemcell from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/stemcells-ubuntu-xenial),
and import it into the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Stemcell Library. For instructions, see [Verify Stemcell Version and Apply All Changes](./install-config.html#stemcell).

1. Download the desired version of the product from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-mysql).

1. Navigate to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard and click **Import a Product** to upload the product file.

1. Under the **Import a Product** button, click **+** next to **<%= vars.product_short %>**. This adds the tile to your staging area.

1. Click the newly-added **<%= vars.product_short %>** tile to review its configuration panes.
Click **Save** on any panes where you make changes.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> To decrease the runtime for service instance upgrades,
      configure the <code>upgrade-all-service-instances</code> errand in the tile.
      For instructions about configuring this errand,
      see <a href="./install-config.html#service-instance-upgrades">Configure Service Instance Upgrades</a>.
    </p>

1. Return to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Dashboard and do the following to complete the installation:

    1. Click **Review Pending Changes**.
    For more information about this <%= vars.ops_manager %> page, see
    [Reviewing Pending Product Changes](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/review-pending-changes.html).<br><br>
    1. Click **Apply Changes**.

1. After the upgrade completes, upgrade all of the MySQL service instances to the new version,
as described in [Upgrade MySQL Instances](#upgrade-instances) below.

Upgrading the <%= vars.product_short %> service and service instances can temporarily interrupt
the service.
For more information, see [Service Interruptions](#interruptions) below.

## <a id="upgrade-instances"></a>Upgrade MySQL Instances

After upgrading the <%= vars.product_short %> service, operators must upgrade existing service instances
to run the new version of the service.
Developers cannot create new bindings to a service instance that has not been upgraded.

To upgrade existing service instances, operators run the following command:

```
bosh -d BROKER-NAME run-errand upgrade-all-service-instances
```

Where `BROKER-NAME` is the deployment name of the broker.

For more information about the `upgrade-all-service-instances` errand, see [upgrade-all-service-instances](./errands.html#upgrade-all-service-instances).

## <a id="interruptions"></a>Service Interruptions

Service changes and upgrades and failures at the process, VM, and IaaS level can cause outages in the <%= vars.product_short %> service, as described below.

Read this section if:

+ You are experiencing a service interruption and are wondering why.
+ You are planning to update or change a service instance and want to know if it might cause a service interruption.

### <a id='service-update'></a>Stemcell or Service Update

An operator updates a stemcell version or their version of <%= vars.product_short %>.

- <strong>Impact:</strong> Apps lose access to the MySQL service while <%= vars.ops_manager %> updates the service instance they are bound to.
          The service should resume within 10–15 minutes.
- <strong>Required Actions:</strong> None. If the update deploys successfully, apps reconnect automatically.

### <a id='change-plan'></a>Plan Change

A developer changes their service instance to provide a different service plan, using `cf update-service` or Apps Manager.

- <strong>Impact:</strong> Apps lose access to the MySQL service while <%= vars.ops_manager %> updates the service instance they are bound to.
          The service should resume within 10–15 minutes.
- <strong>Required Actions:</strong> None. If the plan change deploys successfully, apps reconnect automatically.
