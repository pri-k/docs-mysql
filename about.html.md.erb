Regardless of the specific network layout, the operator must set network rules.

To ensure that connections are open, see the table below:

<table class="nice">

        The BOSH Agent initiates the connection with the BOSH Director.<br><br>

<h3> <a id='lf-ports'></a> Required Networking Rules for Leader-Follower Plans </h3>

If you are using a leader-follower
service plan, the operator must set network rules in addition to the
networking rules required for <%= vars.product_short %>.

To ensure that connections are open, see the table below:


<table class="nice">
	<th>Source VM</th>
	<th>Destination VM</th>
	<th>Default TCP Port</th>
	<th>Notes</th>
	<tr>
		<td><strong>Leader VM</strong></td>
		<td><strong>Follower VM</strong></td>
		<td>8443<br>
				8081
		</td>
		<td>This port is needed if leader-follower is enabled.
				For more information, see <a href="about-leader-follower.html#networking">Networking Rules</a>.<br><br>
				The communication between these VMs is two-way.</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<h3> <a id='hac-ports'></a> Required Networking Rules for Highly Available (HA) Cluster Plans </h3>

If you are using a HA cluster service plan, the operator must set network rules in addition
to the networking rules required for <%= vars.product_short %>.

To ensure that connections are open, see the table below:

<table class="nice">
	<th>Source VM</th>
	<th>Destination VM</th>
	<th>Default TCP Port</th>
	<th>Notes</th>

	<tr>
		<td><strong><%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %></strong></td>
		<td><strong>MySQL service instances</strong></td>
		<td>8083</td>
		<td>This port is needed to monitor cluster health with Switchboard.
			For more information, see <a href="./monitor-health.html">Monitoring Node Health (HA Cluster)</a>.</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td><strong>Jumpbox VM</strong></td>
		<td><strong><%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> UAA</strong></td>
		<td>8443</td>
		<td>This port is needed so that the replication canary can create a UAA client for sending email

<h3> <a id='multi-site-ports'></a> Required Networking Rules for <%= vars.single_leader_plan %> </h3>

<!-- The below partial is in https://github.com/pivotal-cf/docs-partials -->

<%= partial '../../p-mysql/partials/mysql/multi_site_beta' %>

If you are using <%= vars.single_leader_plan_lc %>, the operator must set network rules for
both foundations in addition to the networking rules required for <%= vars.product_short %>.

To ensure that connections are open in both foundations, see the table below:

<table class="nice">
	<th>Source VM</th>
	<th>Destination VM</th>
	<th>Default TCP Port</th>
	<th>Notes</th>

	<tr>
		<td><strong>Leader VM</strong></td>
		<td><strong>Follower VM</strong></td>
		<td>8081 <br>8443<br>18443 <br>3306</td>
		<td>These ports are needed to enable replication between services instance in two different
			foundations. <br><br>The communication between these VMs is two-way.</td>
	</tr>
