## <a id='mysql-ports'></a> Required Networking Rules for MySQL for PCF

Regardless of the specific network layout, the operator must ensure network rules are set up
so that connections are open as described in the table below.

<table class="nice">
	<th>Source Component</th>
	<th>Destination Component</th>
	<th>Default TCP Port</th>
	<th>Notes</th>
	<tr>
		<td><strong>BOSH Agent</strong></td>
		<td><strong>BOSH Director</strong></td>
		<td>4222</td>
		<td>The BOSH Agent runs on every VM in the system, including the BOSH Director VM.
        The BOSH Agent initiates the connection with the BOSH Director.<br><br>
		    The default port is not configurable.<br><br>
				The communication between these components is two-way.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><strong>Broker and service instances</strong></td>
		<td><strong>Doppler on PAS</strong></td>
		<td>8082</td>
		<td>This port is for metrics.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><strong>Deployed apps on PAS</strong></td>
		<td><strong>MySQL service instances</strong></td>
		<td>3306</td>
		<td>This port is for general use, app-specific tasks.
        In addition to configuring your IaaS, create a security group
        for the MySQL service instance.</td>
	</tr>
        <tr>
                <td><strong>ODB</strong></td>

### <a id='lf-ports'></a> Required Networking Rules for Leader-Follower Plans

In addition to the networking rules required for MySQL for PCF, if you are using a leader-follower
service plan, the operator must ensure network rules are set up so that connections are open as described in the table below.

<table class="nice">
	<th>Source VM</th>
	<th>Destination VM</th>
	<th>Default TCP Port</th>
	<th>Notes</th>
	<tr>
		<td><strong>Leader VM</strong></td>
		<td><strong>Follower VM</strong></td>
		<td>8443<br>
				8081
		</td>
		<td>This port is needed if leader-follower is enabled.
				For more information, see <a href="maintain-leader-follower.html#config-plan">Configure a Leader-Follower Service Plan</a>.<br><br>
				The communication between these VMs is two-way.</td>
	</tr>
</table>

### <a id='hac-ports'></a> Required Networking Rules for Highly Available (HA) Cluster Plans

In addition to the networking rules required for MySQL for PCF, if you are using a highly available
cluster service plan, the operator must ensure network rules are set up so that connections are open
as described in the table below.

<%= partial "./mysql/galera_beta" %>

<table class="nice">
	<th>Source VM</th>
	<th>Destination VM</th>
	<th>Default TCP Port</th>
	<th>Notes</th>

	<tr>
		<td><strong>PAS</strong></td>
		<td><strong>MySQL service instances</strong></td>
		<td>8083</td>
		<td>This port is needed to monitor cluster health with Switchboard.
			For more information, see <a href="./monitor-health.html">Monitoring Node Health (HA Cluster)</a>.</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td><strong>Jumpbox VM</strong></td>
		<td><strong>PAS UAA</strong></td>
		<td>8443</td>
		<td>This port is needed so that the replication canary can create a UAA client for sending email
			notifications. For more information, see <a href="./replication-canary.html">About the Replication Canary</a>.</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td><strong>HA cluster node</strong></td>
		<td><strong>HA cluster node</strong></td>
		<td>4567<br>
				4568<br>
				4444
		</td>
		<td>This port is needed to maintain network connectivity between nodes in an HA cluster.
			For more information,
			see <a href="https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-xtradb-cluster/LATEST/security/secure-network.html#firewall-configuration">Firewall Configuration</a>
			in the Percona XtraDB Cluster documentation.<br><br>
			The communication between these VMs is two-way.

	</tr>
	<tr>

		<td><strong>Galera healthcheck</strong></td>
		<td>9200</td>
		<td>This port is for monitoring the health of nodes in an HA cluster.<br><br>
