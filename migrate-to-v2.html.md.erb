title: Migrating Data from v1 to v2
owner: MySQL
---

This topic describes how to migrate the data from a MySQL for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) v1.x service instance to a MySQL for PCF v2.x service instance.

## <a id='prepare'></a>Prerequisites

To perform the procedures in this topic, you must have the following:

* An existing MySQL for PCF v1.x service instance with the data you want to migrate
* MySQL for PCF v2.x installed in the same PCF environment as your PCF v1.x service instance
* At least one MySQL for PCF v2.x service plan available in the same space as your MySQL for PCF v1.x service instance
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: To view available service plans, run <code>cf marketplace</code>. 
    MySQL for PCF v2.x appears as `p.mysql` and MySQL for PCF v1.x appears as `p-mysql`.</p>

## <a id='stop-unbind'></a>Stop and Unbind Apps

Do the following to stop and unbind any apps that use your MySQL for PCF v1.x service instance:

1. Use the cf CLI to target and log in to your PCF deployment. 
For example:
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ cf target api.example.com
  $ cf login
  </pre>
  When prompted, enter your credentials and target the org and space where the MySQL for PCF v1.x is located.

1. Stop any traffic to the MySQL for PCF v1.x database by stopping any apps that are bound to the service instance.
  Run the following command for each app bound to the instance:
  ```
  cf stop APP
  ```
  <br>
  Where APP is the name of your app.
  <br><br>
  For example:
 <pre class="terminal">
  $ cf stop my-app
    Stopping app my-app in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
    OK
 </pre>
  To retrieve a list of bound apps, run `cf services`.
  
1. Unbind your app from the MySQL for PCF v1.x service instance.
  Run the following command for each app bound to the instance:
  ```
  cf unbind-service APP V1-INSTANCE
  ```
  <br>
  Where:
  * `APP` is the name of your app.
  * `V1-INSTANCE` is the name of your MySQL for PCF v1.x service instance.
  <br><br>
  For example:
  <pre class="terminal">
   $ cf unbind-service my-app my-instance
    Unbinding app my-app from service my-v1-instance in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
    OK
  </pre>

## <a id='migrate-data'></a>Migrate Data

To migrate the data from the MySQL for PCF v1.x service instance to a new MySQL for PCF v2.x service instance, choose one of the following:

* [Use the Migrate Option](#migrate-option): This option forms the name of the newly created MySQL for PCF v2.x service instance by appending `-new` to the name of the MySQL for PCF v1.x service instance. 
* [Use the Replace Option](#replace-option): This option renames the MySQL for PCF v1.x service instance by appending `-old` and gives the original name of the instance to the newly created MySQL for PCF v2.x service instance.

The following table illustrates the difference between migrate and replace:

<table id='mysql-odb-vs-pre' border="1" class="nice">
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>Name of v1 Instance Before</th>
    <th>Name of v1 Instance After</th>
    <th>Name of v2 Instance</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Migrate</th>
    <td><code>my-instance</code></td>
    <td><code>my-instance</code></td>
    <td><code>my-instance-new</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Replace</th>
    <td><code>my-instance</code></td>
    <td><code>my-instance-old</code></td>
    <td><code>my-instance</code></td>
  </tr>
</table>

### <a id='migrate-option'></a>Use the Migrate Option

Do the following to use the migrate option to migrate your data:

1. Install the `cf mysql-tools` plugin.
1. Use the plugin to migrate your data.
  Run the following command:

    ```
    cf mysql-tools migrate V1-INSTANCE --create V2-PLAN
    ```
    <br>
    Where:
    * `V1-INSTANCE` is the name of your MySQL for PCF v1.x service instance.
    * `V2-PLAN` is the name of the MySQL for PCF v2.x service plan to use for the new MySQL for PCF v2.x service instance. 
    For example, `db-small`. 
    To view available MySQL for PCF v2.x service plans, run `cf marketplace` and locate the plans under `p.mysql`.
    <br><br>
    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf mysql-tools migrate my-instance --create db-small
    2018/04/24 11:31:19 Creating new service instance "my-instance-new" for service p.mysql using plan db-small
    2018/04/24 11:41:01 Unpacking assets for migration to /var/folders/dm/66n2j9xx02l8vs58q2whz4080000gn/T/migrate_app_101341527
    2018/04/24 11:41:02 Started to push app
    Done uploading
    2018/04/24 11:41:09 Successfully pushed app
    2018/04/24 11:41:10 Successfully bound app to v1 instance
    2018/04/24 11:41:12 Successfully bound app to v2 instance
    2018/04/24 11:41:12 Starting migration app
    2018/04/24 11:41:25 Started to run migration task
    2018/04/24 11:41:27 Migration completed successfully
    2018/04/24 11:41:29 Cleaning up...
    </pre>

### <a id='replace-option'></a>Use the Replace Option

1. Install the `cf mysql-tools` plugin.
1. Use the plugin to migrate your data.
  Run the following command:

    ```
    cf mysql-tools replace V1-INSTANCE --create V2-PLAN
    ```
    <br>
    Where:
    * `V1-INSTANCE` is the name of your MySQL for PCF v1.x service instance.
    * `V2-PLAN` is the name of the MySQL for PCF v2.x service plan to use for the new MySQL for PCF v2.x service instance.

    </pre>

## <a id='validate-data'></a>Validate Data

After migrating your data, you must verify that the data has successfully migrated by validating the data in the new MySQL for PCF v2.x service instance. 
You can validate the data by creating an SSH tunnel to gain direct command line access to the new MySQL for PCF v2.x service instance.

Do the following to create an SSH tunnel to the instance and validate your data:

1. Perform the steps in [Push Your Host App](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/deploy-apps/ssh-services.html#push-app) to push an app that will act as the host for the SSH tunnel.

1. Perform the steps in [Create Your Service Key](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/deploy-apps/ssh-services.html#bind-app) to create a service key for your MySQL for PCF v2.x service instance.

1. Perform the steps in [Configure Your SSH Tunnel](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/deploy-apps/ssh-services.html#ssh-tunnel) to configure an SSH tunnel to your MySQL for PCF v2.x service instance.

1. Perform the steps in [Access Your Service Instance](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/deploy-apps/ssh-services.html#access-service) to establish direct command-line access to your MySQL for PCF v2.x service instance.

1. From the MySQL shell, validate that the data that you expect to see has been imported into the MySQL for PCF v2.x service instance.

1. Exit the MySQL shell and kill the SSH tunnel.

## <a id='rebind-restage'></a>Rebind and Restage Apps

To complete the migration, rebind and restage any apps that had been bound to the original MySQL for PCF v1.x service instance. 

Do the following to rebind and restage your apps:

1. Bind the app to the new service instance.
Run the following command:

    ```
    cf bind-service APP V2-INSTANCE
    ```
    <br>
    Where:
    * `APP` is the name of your app.
    * `V2-INSTANCE` is the name of your MySQL for PCF v2.x service instance.
    <br><br>
    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf bind-service my-app my-instance-new
    Binding service my-instance-new to app my-app in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
    OK
    TIP: Use 'cf restage my-app' to ensure your env variable changes take effect
    </pre>
 
1. Restage the app.
  For example:
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ cf restage my-app
  Restaging app my-app in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
  [...]
  </pre>
  The app is now using your new MySQL for PCF v2.x service instance and should be operational again.
