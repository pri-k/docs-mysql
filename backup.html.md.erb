This topic describes how to enable, configure, and use backups in MySQL for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).

## <a id="overview"></a>Overview ##

Automated backups have the following features:

- Periodically create and upload backup artifacts suitable for restoring the complete set of database instances allocated in the service
- No locks, no downtime
- The only effect on the serving systems is the amount of I/O required to copy the database and log files off of the VM
- Includes a metadata file that contains the critical details of the backup artifact, including the effective calendar time of the backup
- Backup artifacts are encrypted within the MySQL for PCF cluster of VMs; unencrypted data is never transported outside of the MySQL for PCF deployment

## <a id="enable-backups"></a>Enable Automated Backups ##

You can configure MySQL for PCF to automatically back up its databases to external storage.

* **How and Where**: There are two options for how automated backups transfer backup data and where the data saves out to:
  - MySQL for PCF runs an `scp` command that secure-copies backup files to a VM or physical machine operating outside of PCF. The operator provisions the backup machine separately from their PCF installation. This is the most efficient option.
  - MySQL for PCF runs an [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/s3/) client that saves backups to an Amazon S3 bucket, [Ceph](http://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/) storage cluster, or other S3-compatible endpoint certified by Pivotal.

* **When**: Backups follow a schedule that you specify with a [cron](http://godoc.org/github.com/robfig/cron) expression.

* **What**: You can back up just the primary node, or all nodes in the cluster.

To enable automated backups and configure them for options above, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to the MySQL for Pivotal Cloud Foundry tile on the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.
1. Click **Backups**.
1. Under **Backups**, click **Enable Backups**.
  <%= image_tag('enable-backups.png') %>
1. For **Cron Schedule**, enter a cron schedule for the backups. The syntax is similar to traditional cron, with additional features such as `@every 1d`, which specifies daily backups. See the cron Go library [documentation](https://godoc.org/github.com/robfig/cron) for more information.
1. If you want to back up all nodes, select the **Back up all nodes** checkbox.
1. To enable backups using [Ceph](http://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/) or AWS, continue to the [Ceph or AWS](#ceph-aws) section. To enable backups using SCP, continue to the [SCP](#scp) section.

### <a id='ceph-aws'></a>Ceph or AWS

To back up your database on Ceph or Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3, perform the following steps:

1. Select **Ceph or Amazon S3**.
  <br><%= image_tag('configure-backups-s3.png') %>
1. Enter your **S3 Endpoint URL**. For instance, `https://s3.amazonaws.com`.
1. Enter your **S3 Bucket Name**. Do not include an `s3:// prefix`, a trailing `/`, or underscores. If the bucket does not already exist, it will be created automatically.
1. For **Bucket Path**, specify a folder within the bucket to hold your MySQL backups. Do not include a trailing `/`. If the folder does not already exist, it will be created automatically.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You must use this folder exclusively for this cluster's backup artifacts. Mixing the backup artifacts from different clusters within a single folder can cause confusion and possible inadvertent loss of backup artifacts.</p>
1. For **AWS Access Key ID** and **AWS Secret Access Key**, enter your Ceph or AWS credentials. For AWS, Pivotal recommends creating an [IAM](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/) credential that only has access to this bucket.
1. Click **Save**.

### <a id='scp'></a>SCP

To back up your database using SCP, perform the following steps:

1. Select **SCP to a Remote Host**.
<%= image_tag('configure-backups-scp.png') %>
1. Enter the **Username**, **Hostname**, and **Destination Directory** for the backups.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Pivotal recommends using a VM not within the PCF deployment for the destination of SCP backups. SCP enables the operator to use any desired storage solution on the destination VM.</p>
1. For **Private Key**, paste in the private key that will be used to encrypt the SCP transfer.
1. Enter the **SCP Port**. SCP runs on port 22 by default.
1. Click **Save**.

## <a id="disable-backups"></a>Disable Automated Backups ##

To disable automated backups, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to the MySQL for Pivotal Cloud Foundry tile on the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.
1. Click **Backups**.
  <%= image_tag('disable-backups.png') %>
1. Under **Backups**, click **Disable Backups**.
1. Under **Backup Destination**, click **No Backups**.
1. Click **Save**.
1. In the left navigation, click **Resource Config**.
1. Change the number of instances for **Backup Prepare Node** from `1` to `0`.
1. Click **Save**.
1. Return to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Apply Changes**.

To configure automated backups for MySQL for PCF, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to the MySQL for Pivotal Cloud Foundry tile on the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.
1. Click **Backups**.

## <a id="understanding-metadata"></a>Understand Backup Metadata ##

Along with each release, MySQL for PCF will upload a `mysql-backup-XXXXXXXXXX.txt` metadata file. 

The contents of the metadata file resemble the following:

```
uuid = dfe9fcdd-7d0f-11e5-93b3-0695a7b9771f
name =
tool_name = innobackupex
tool_command = --user=root --password=... --stream=tar tmp/
tool_version = 1.5.1-xtrabackup
ibbackup_version = xtrabackup version 2.2.10 based on MySQL server 5.6.22 Linux (x86_64) (revision id: )
server_version = 10.0.21-MariaDB-wsrep
start_time = 2015-10-28 01:04:40
end_time = 2015-10-28 01:04:43
lock_time = 1
binlog_pos =
innodb_from_lsn = 0
innodb_to_lsn = 1730899
partial = N
incremental = N
format = tar
compact = N
compressed = N
encrypted = N
```

Within this file, the most important items are the `start_time` and the `server_version` entries. Transactions that have not been completed at the start of the backup effort will not be present in the restored artifact.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Both <code>compressed</code> and <code>encrypted</code> show as <code>N</code> in this file, yet the artifact uploaded by MySQL for PCF is both compressed and encrypted. This is a known bug.</p>

## <a id="restoring"></a>Restore a Backup Artifact ###

MySQL for PCF keeps at least two complete copies of the data. In most cases, if a cluster is still able to connect to persistent storage, you can restore a cluster to health using the [bootstrap process](bootstrapping.html). Before resorting to a database restore, contact [Pivotal Support](https://support.pivotal.io) to ensure your existing cluster is beyond help.

The disaster recovery backups feature of MySQL for PCF is primarily intended as a way to recover data to the same PCF deployment from which the data was backed up. This process replaces 100% of the data and state of a running MySQL for PCF cluster. This is especially relevant with regard to service instances and bindings. 

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Because of how services instances are defined, you cannot restore a MySQL for PCF database to a different PCF deployment.</p>

In the event of a total cluster loss, the process to restore a backup artifact to a MySQL for PCF cluster is entirely manual. Perform the following steps to use the offsite backups to restore your cluster to its previous state:

1. Discover the encryption keys in the **Credentials** tab of the MySQL for PCF tile.
1. If necessary, install the same version of the **MySQL for PCF** product in the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.
1. Perform the following steps to reduce the size of the MySQL for PCF cluster to a single node:
    1. From the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard, click the **MySQL for PCF** tile.
    1. Click **Resource Config**.
    1. Set the number of instances for **MySQL Server** to 1.
    1. Click **Save**.
    1. Return to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Apply Changes**.
1. After the deployment finishes, perform the following steps to prepare the first node for restoration:
    1. SSH into the Ops Manager Director. For more information, see the [SSH into Ops Manager](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#ssh) section in the <em>Advanced Troubleshooting with the BOSH CLI</em> topic.
    1. Retrieve the IP address for the MySQL server by navigating to the **MySQL for PCF** tile and clicking the **Status** tab.
    1. Retrieve the VM credentials for the MySQL server by navigating to the **MySQL for PCF** tile and clicking the **Credentials** tab.
    1. From the Ops Manager Director VM, use the BOSH CLI to SSH into the first MySQL job. For more information, see the [BOSH SSH](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-7/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#bosh-ssh) section in the <em>Advanced Troubleshooting with the BOSH CLI</em> topic.
    1. On the MySQL server VM, become super user:
      <pre class="terminal">$ sudo su</pre>
    1. Pause the local database server:
      <pre class="terminal">$ monit stop all</pre>
    1. Confirm that all jobs are listed as `not monitored`:
      <pre class="terminal">$ watch monit summary</pre>
    1. Delete the existing MySQL data that is stored on disk:
      <pre class="terminal">$ rm -rf /var/vcap/store/mysql/*</pre>
1. Perform the following steps to restore the backup:
    1. Move the compressed backup file to the node using `scp`.
    1. Decrypt the file using the `gpg` command:
      <pre class="terminal">$ gpg --decrypt mysql-backup.tar.gpg</pre>
    1. Expand the backup artifact into the data director of MySQL:
      <pre class="terminal">$ tar xvjf mysql-backup.tar.bzip2 --directory=/var/vcap/store/mysql</pre>
    1. Change the owner of the data directory, because MySQL expects the data directory to be owned by a particular user:
      <pre class="terminal">$ chown -R vcap:vcap /var/vcap/store/mysql</pre>
    1. Start all services with `monit`:
      <pre class="terminal">$ monit start all</pre>
    1. Watch the summary until all jobs are listed as `running`:
      <pre class="terminal">$ watch monit summary</pre> 
    1. Exit out of the MySQL node.
1. Perform the following steps to increase the size of the cluster back to three:
    1. From the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard, click the **MySQL for PCF** tile.
    1. Click **Resource Config**.
    1. Set the number of instances for **MySQL Server** to 1.
    1. Click **Save**.
    1. Return to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Apply Changes**.

## <a id="manual-process"></a>Perform Manual Backup ##

If you do not want to use the automated backups included in MySQL for PCF, you can perform backups manually.

### <a id="manual-ip-creds"></a>Retrieve IP Address and Credentials ###

Perform the following steps to retrieve the IP address and credentials required for a manual backup:

1. From the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard, click the **MySQL for PCF** tile. 
1. Click the **Status** tab.
1. Locate the IP address for the MySQL node under **MySQL Server**.
    ![MySQL Server IP](mysql-server-ip.png)
1. Locate the root password for the MySQL server in the **Credentials** tab.
    ![MySQL Server Root Password](mysql-root-password.png)

### <a id="manual-backup"></a>Manual Backup ###

Back up your data manually with [mysqldump](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/mysqldump/).
  This backup acquires a global read lock on all tables, but does not hold it for the entire duration of the dump.

To back up all databases in the MySQL deployment, use the `--all-databases` flag:
<pre class="terminal">
$ mysqldump -u root -p -h $MYSQL\_NODE\_IP --all-databases > user_databases.sql
</pre>

To back up a single database, specify the database name:
<pre class="terminal">
$ mysqldump -u root -p -h $MYSQL\_NODE\_IP $DB\_NAME > user_databases.sql
</pre>

### <a id="manual-restore"></a>Manual Restore ###

The procedure for restoring from a backup is the same whether one or multiple databases were backed up.
Executing the SQL dump will drop, recreate, and refill the specified databases and tables.

  <p class="warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> Restoring a database will delete all data that existed in the database prior to the restore. Restoring a database using a full backup artifact, produced by <code>mysqldump --all-databases</code> for example, will replace all data and user permissions.</p>

To restore from the data dump, run the following command:

<pre class="terminal">$ mysql -u root -p -h $MYSQL\_NODE\_IP < user\_databases.sql</pre>

To re-apply users privileges, tell the cluster to re-load user permissions using the data that has just been restored:

<pre class="terminal">$ mysql -u root -p -h $MYSQL\_NODE\_IP -e "FLUSH PRIVILEGES"</pre>

For more examples of manual backup and restore procedures, see the [MariaDB documentation](http://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/mysqldump/#examples).
