This topic provides techniques app developers can use to begin troubleshooting on-demand instances.

## <a id="inaccessible"></a>If Instances or Database are Inaccessible

You may experience the following during upgrades or in a leader-follower topology.

### <a id="outages"></a>Temporary Outages

MySQL for PCF service instances can become temporarily inaccessible during upgrades and VM or network failures. 
See [Service Interruptions](./upgrade.html#interruptions) for more information.

### <a id="read-only"></a>Apps Cannot Write to the Database

If you have a leader-follower topology and your apps can no longer write to the database, the leader VM may be read-only. 
Contact your operator to check if the leader VM is read-only. 
For more information on troubleshooting this problem, see 
[Both Leader and Follower Instances Are Both Read-Only](./troubleshoot.html#both-read-only).

## <a id="errors"></a> Troubleshoot Errors

You may see an error when using the Cloud Foundry Command-Line Interface (cf CLI) to perform basic operations on a MySQL for PCF service instance:

* `cf create`
* `cf update`
* `cf bind`
* `cf unbind`
* `cf delete`

### <a id="parse-error"></a>Understand a Cloud Foundry (CF) Error Message

<%= partial '../../mysql/odb/tshoot-tech-parse-error' %>

### <a id="instance"></a> Find Information About your Service Instance

You may need to find the name, GUID, or other information about a service instance. To find this information, do the following:

1. Log into the space containing the instance or failed instance. 
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf login
    </pre>

1. If you do not know the name of the service instance, run `cf services` to see a listing of all service instances in the space. 
The service instances are listed in the `name` column.
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf services
    Getting services in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
    OK
    name          service      plan        bound apps    last operation
    my-instance   p.mysql      db-small                  create succeeded
    </pre>

1. Run `cf service SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME` to retrieve more information about a specific instance.

1. Run `cf service SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME --guid` to retrieve the GUID of the instance, which is useful for debugging.
