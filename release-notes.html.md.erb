## <a id="2-6-7"></a> v2.6.7

**Release Date: February 24, 2020**

### Features

* Added metrics to monitor persistent disk, ephemeral disk, and number of connections for 
MySQL service instances in the Indicator Dashboard under the Healthwatch tile.

* Operator can now run a broker errand `recreate-all-service-instances` to recreate VMs of their MySQL service instances.


### Resolved Issues

This release has the following fixes:

* An inaccurate generic message no longer appears when trying to migrate from single node or leader follower plan to HA cluster
when trying to do so using `cf update-service`. We now fail fast to indicate that this is an unsupported workflow.

* Backups should no longer silently fail when configured with an SCP endpoint.

* Custom schema creation and binding with invalid characters fails with an error message stating the permitted characters.

## <a id="2-6-0"></a> v2.6.0

**Release Date: June 19, 2019**

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

+ When you upgrade to MySQL for PCF v2.6, MySQL for PCF automatically rotates internal certificates for single node and leader-follower service instances. The new certificates do not expire for 5 years. MySQL for PCF does not automatically rotate TLS certificates or certificates for HA cluster service instances during upgrades.
  For more information, see [Rotating Certificates](./rotating-ca.html).
  <p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> If your internal certificates expire, service bindings and backups fail. </p>

+ HA cluster plans are compatible with plugins for Encryption at Rest.

+ Handling is improved for empty data directories on initialization.

+ MySQL for PCF relies significantly more on bpm (BOSH Process Manager) for how it launches jobs.
  For general information about bpm, see [bpm](https://bosh.io/docs/bpm/bpm/) in the BOSH documentation.

+ New MySQL property configurations improve performance of HA cluster plans.

+ The Percona Server version is updated to v5.7.24-26.

+ The golang version is updated to v1.12.x.

### Resolved Issues

This release has the following fixes:

+ Java apps can use HA cluster plans with or without enabling TLS.
