This is documentation for the MySQL for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) service tile. The tile can be downloaded from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-mysql/).

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>:
This documents MySQL for PCF v1.9, a pre-provisioned service that supports single-node or high-availability cluster architectures. For the on-demand service that creates dedicated service instances dynamically, see the v2.0 documentation <a href="http://docs.pivotal.io/p-mysql/2-0">here</a> or select <strong>v2.0</strong> from the version dropdown at the top of this page.</p>

## <a id="about-mysql"></a>About MySQL##

MySQL is a powerful open-source relational database used by apps since the mid-90s. Developers have relied on MySQL as a first step to storing, processing and sharing data. As its user community has grown, MySQL has become a robust system capable of handling a wide variety of use cases and very significant workloads. Unlike other traditional databases which centralize and consolidate data, MySQL lends itself to dedicated deployment supporting the "shared nothing" context of building apps in the cloud.

## <a id="about-p-mysql"></a>About MySQL for PCF ##

The MySQL for PCF product delivers a fully managed, "Database as a Service" to Cloud Foundry users. The tile deploys and maintains a MySQL server running a recent release of [MariaDB](http://www.mariadb.org) and [Galera](http://galeracluster.com); an SQL proxy, [Switchboard](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/switchboard); and a service broker. The tile configures sane defaults for a general-use relational database service.

With MySQL for PCF installed, developers can attach a database to their apps in as little as two commands, `cf create-service` and `cf bind-service`. Developers can retrieve connection credentials in the [standard manner](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/deploy-apps/environment-variable.html#VCAP-SERVICES), from the `VCAP-SERVICES` environment variable. Developers can select from a menu of service plans options, which are configured by the platform operator.

You can deploy MySQL for PCF in either single-node or high availability (HA) topology. The HA topology has three MySQL servers, two proxies, and two service brokers, and you need to supply a load balancer.

## <a id="upgrading"></a>Prepare to Upgrade ##


Before upgrading to the latest version of MySQL for PCF, do the following:

1. Confirm that you are on Ops Manager v1.9 or later and are on MySQL for PCF v1.8 or later.

    <table border="1" class="nice">
    <tr>
    	<th rowspan="2">Ops Manager Version</th>
    	<th colspan="2">Supported Upgrades from Imported MySQL Installation</th>
    </tr>
      <tr>
      	<th>From</th>
      	<th>To</th>
      <tr>
    <tr>
      <th rowspan="3">v1.9.x, v1.10.x</th>
      <tr><td>v1.8.x</td><td rowspan="2">latest v1.9.x</td></tr>
      <tr><td>v1.9.x</tr>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th rowspan="3">v1.11.x</th>
      <td>v1.8.x</td><td>Not supported</td></tr>
      <tr><td rowspan="2">v1.9.x</td><td>Not supported</td></tr>
      <tr><td>latest v1.10.x</td></tr>
    </tr>
    </table><br>

    For more information about upgrade versions, see the [Product Compatibility Matrix](https://docs.pivotal.io/resources/product-compatibility-matrix.pdf).

1. If you are running in the HA configuration, check the health of the cluster:
  1. Download, configure, and run the [mysql-diag](http://bit.ly/pivotal-mysql-diag) tool.
  2. If `mysql-diag` shows any cluster issues, fix them.
  3. Do not apply changes to the upgrade until the issues have been resolved.

1. As of v1.9.0, MySQL for PCF enables strict mode.
This means that where previously large indices were silently truncated,
now `ALTER TABLE` and `CREATE INDEX` statements may fail with an error.
<p class='note'><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: If any of your apps already use or want to create indices
with more than 767 bytes, then create or alter the apps to use `ROW_FORMAT DYNAMIC` or `ROW_FORMAT COMPRESSED`.</p>
A workaround for failures due to strict mode is to use the `IGNORE` keyword: this converts the error to a warning. <br>

## <a id="deprecation-lock-tables"></a>Deferred: Deprecation of Table Locks

In previous releases, we've advertised the intent to deprecate table locks for all service bindings. This has been deferred to a later release.

## <a id="ha-topology"></a>High Availability Topology

This section contains information you should know before deploying MySQL for PCF in a multi-node HA topology.

### <a id="scaling-process"></a>Scaling Process

When you scale MySQL for PCF from a single-node to a multi-node HA topology, this single node is restarted and reconfigured as a part of a cluster. During the restart, apps consuming MySQL for PCF lose their connection to the node. The apps should be able to reconnect once the MySQL node is restarted.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Apps that are not using MySQL for PCF are not affected by this scaling process when you redeploy Elastic Runtime (ERT).</p>

In addition, redeploying ERT with the MySQL cluster means that the PCF API will not be available for a brief period of time. For example, you are not able to push apps or query their state during this time.

### <a id="limitations"></a>High Availability Limitations

When deployed in HA topology, MySQL for PCF runs three master nodes. This cluster arrangement imposes some limitations that you should be aware of, which do not apply to single-node MySQL database servers.

- Although two proxy instances are deployed by default, there is no automation to direct clients from one to the other. See the note in the [Proxy](proxy.html) section. To address this, configure a load balancer as described in the [Proxy](#proxy) section.
- MySQL for PCF only supports the InnoDB storage engine; it is the default storage engine for new tables. Pre-existing tables that are not InnoDB are at risk because they are not replicated within a cluster.
- The database servers are shared, managed by multi-tenant processes to serve apps across the PCF deployment. Although data is securely isolated between tenants using unique credentials, app performance may be impacted by noisy neighbors.
- Round-trip latency between database nodes must be less than five seconds. Latency exceeding this results in a network partition. If more than half of the nodes are partitioned, the cluster loses quorum and become unusable until manually bootstrapped.
- See also the list of [Known Limitations](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/mariadb-galera-cluster-known-limitations/) in MariaDB cluster.
