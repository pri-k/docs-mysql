<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes how to manually create a logical backup with `mysqldump` and restore a MySQL database with the backup.

## <a id="overview"></a> Overview

The operator configures automated physical backups of your MySQL database.
Developers do not have access to physical backups. In most cases, if you want to copy a <%= vars.product_full %> database you should use the `migrate` command.

However, you might want to create an additional logical backup in the following use cases:

+ Migrating a <%= vars.product_full %> database to an off-platform database.
+ Backing up specific individual databases.
+ Editing table definitions or insert statements before restoring the database.


A logical backup reproduces the table structure and data, without copying the InnoDB data files.
The backup contains unencrypted SQL statements to re-create the data.
Because of this, restoring a logical backup takes longer that restoring a physical backup.
While the backup is running, operations against the database are stalled.


For information about automated backups configured by operators,
see [Backing Up and Restoring On-Demand MySQL for VMware Tanzu](./backup-and-restore.html).

For information about using the `migrate` command, see [About Data Migration in MySQL for VMware Tanzu](./about-migrate.html).

## <a id="manual-backup"></a> Create a Logical Backup

<%= vars.product_short %> disables remote admin access to MySQL databases.
Because of this, you must create a service key to access the database for the service instance you want to back up.

To back up your <%= vars.product_short %> data manually:

1. Target the Cloud Controller of your <%= vars.platform_name %> deployment by running:

    ```
    cf api api.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN
    ```
   For example:
   <pre class="terminal">$ cf api api.sys.cf-example.com</pre>
1. Log in:

    ```
    cf login
    ```
1. Create a service key for the MySQL service instance by running:

    ```
    cf create-service-key SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME SERVICE-KEY-NAME \
    -c '{"read-only":true}'
    ```
    Where:
    * `SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME` is the name of the existing MySQL service instance
       that contains the data you want to back up.
    * `SERVICE-KEY-NAME` is a name you choose for the new service key.

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf create-service-key mydb backup-key \
    -c '{"read-only":true}'
    Creating service key backup-key for service instance mydb as user...
    OK
    </pre>

1. Retrieve the credentials for the service by running:

    ```
    cf service-key SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME SERVICE-KEY-NAME
    ```
    Where:
    * `SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME` is the name of the MySQL service instance you created a service key for.
    * `SERVICE-KEY-NAME` is the name of the newly created service key.

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf service-key mydb backup-key
    Getting key backup-key for service instance mydb as user...

    {
     "hostname": "q-n3s3y1.q-g696.bosh",
     "jdbcUrl": "jdbc:mysql://q-n3s3y1.q-g696.bosh:3306/cf\_e2d148a8\_1baa\_4961\_b314_2431f57037e5?user=abcdefghijklm\u0026password=123456789",
     "name": "cf\_e2d148a8\_1baa\_4961\_b314\_2431f57037e5",
     "password": "123456789",
     "port": 3306,
     "uri": "mysql://abcdefghijklm:123456789<span>@</span>q-n3s3y1.q-g696.bosh:3306/cf\_e2d148a8\_1baa\_4961\_b314\_2431f57037e5?reconnect=true",
     "username": "abcdefghijklm"
    }
    </pre>

1. Record the following values:
    * `hostname`: The MySQL BOSH DNS hostname
    * `password`: The password for the user that can be used to perform backups of the service instance database
    * `username`: The username for the user that can be used to perform backups of the service instance database

1. Connect to the database, by either using an SSH tunnel or by connecting directly to its IP address.
For more information, see [Establish a Connection to a Service Instance from Outside Your <%= vars.platform_name %> Deployment](./establish.html).

1. View a list of your databases by running:
<pre><code>mysql --user=USERNAME --password=PASSWORD \
--host=MYSQL-IP \
--silent --silent --execute='show databases'</code></pre>

    Where:
    * `USERNAME` is the username retrieved from the output of `cf service-key`.
    * `PASSWORD` is the password retrieved from the output of `cf service-key`.
    * `MYSQL-IP` is the MySQL IP address. This value is `0` if you are connecting using an SSH tunnel.

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ mysql --user=abcdefghijklm --password=123456789 \
    --host=10.10.10.5 \
    --silent --execute='show databases'
    </pre>

1. Do not back up the following databases:
    * `cf_metadata`
    * `information_schema`
    * `mysql`
    * `performance_schema`
    * `sys`

1. For each remaining database, back up by running:

    ```
    mysqldump --set-gtid-purged=off --single-transaction \
    --user=USERNAME --password=PASSWORD \
    --host=MYSQL-IP \
    --databases DB-NAME > BACKUP.sql
    ```

    Where:
    * `USERNAME` is the username retrieved from the output of `cf service-key`.
    * `PASSWORD` is the password retrieved from the output of `cf service-key`.
    * `MYSQL-IP` is the MySQL IP address.
    * `DB-NAME` is the name of the database.
    * `BACKUP` is a name you create for the backup file. Use a different filename for each backup.

    The `--set-gtid-purged=off` flag enables you to restore the backup without admin privileges. <br><br>

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ mysqldump --set-gtid-purged=off --single-transaction \
    --user=abcdefghijklm --password=123456789 \
    --host=10.10.10.5 \
    --databases canary\_db > canary\_db.sql
    </pre>

## <a id="restore-backup"></a> Restore from a Logical Backup

To restore a logical backup:

1. (Optional) If you want to create a new service instance,
do the procedure in [Create a Service Instance](./use.html#create).

1. Retrieve the credentials for your service instance, do steps 1 through 5 in
[Create a Logical Backup](#manual-backup) above.

1. Restore your data from the SQL file on your local machine by running:

    ```
    mysql --user=USERNAME --password=PASSWORD --host=MYSQL-IP  < dump.sql
    ```
    Where:
    * `USERNAME` is the username retrieved from the output of `cf service-key`.
    * `PASSWORD` is the password retrieved from the output of `cf service-key`.
    * `MYSQL-IP` is the MySQL IP address.
